WEBVTT Hey, morning everyone, and welcome to G'S 2024 Investor Day. it's great to see so many people here in our Sydney offices and of course welcome also to all of you who are joining us online today. we're holding this session today on the lands of the Gadigal people, and IG acknowledges traditional owners of country throughout Australia and recognize their continuing connections to land, waters and the communities. And of course, I pay my respects to elders past, present and emerging. In terms of this morning's agenda. We'll start with a presentation on our technology roadmap from Neil and then Julie, Jared and Amanda are gonna provide an update on their strategies and the progress that you'll see we are making in each of the divisions. We're obviously pleased to announce these strategic alliance last week with RACQ, and Neil and Julie are gonna talk about how our investment in our enterprise platform reduces that integration risks and really does demonstrate long-term benefits to what we've been investing in. We will pause this webcast, so everyone on the, on the webcast, we'll pause this a about 10 10 and we're gonna have two breakout sessions focusing on our, on sort of customer and productivity initiatives that are, that are for the people in the room to attend. We'll res e back in here at about 1130 and Williams's gonna provide an update around around finance and capital 1145. Then everyone will all be on stage, open to q and a and the whole team will be, will step up here and though for those in the room, we'll invite you to join us for lunch which we imagine will start around about 1230. So please hang around and you've got the whole of the IG executive team here today, not just those presenting. So in terms of today, what we're gonna do is provide you an update on our sort of strategic outlook and what, and sort of our confidence about the future as we're successfully delivering on our, around our purpose, about around making your world a safer place. And as we sort of look out to 2030 and the opportunities in front of us, sort of it's important on a day like today to reflect on, on things that have occurred and how we've got here and what, and what we're really sure about is that IAG is a stronger and a more resilient company today than we have been. So sort of in terms of, of sort of strategy, it's a, and that's relatively simple. We're focused entirely on general insurance products in Australia and New Zealand. As you know, structurally we've separated out and differentiated our retail and our intermediated businesses, ensuring that those two businesses are focused on their different customer and their different product segments. In Australia, our partnership that we announced last week around RACQ means that our insurance products are now being distributed through three of the strongest brands in financial services in our markets. We've simplified our brand offering in South Australia and Western Australia and we've firmly established NRMA insurance as a national brand outside of Victoria in New Zealand. Amanda will explain how we've differentiated our A MI and our state offerings and we've materially uplifted our risk capability across IIG. And as you know, we're using reinsurance in innovative ways to reduce our volatility. So strategically, IG is a simpler business today. As part of that simplification agenda, we've reduced the complexity of our retail product offerings and we've aligned our leadership structures. Our most recent pulse survey, which saw a strong engagement score of around 78 for our 14,000 people who work for us across Australia and New Zealand. And of course that's important 'cause it's our people are sort of key to driving the trust in our brands that exist. As you know, NRMA insurance is the most trusted brand in insurance in our markets. And of course these are flowing through to positive customer metrics where we see high NPS results in both Australia and New Zealand businesses. And we continue to have really strong retention rates and we'll show you those. So these strong customer metrics sort of help set us up well for what we see as opportunities for growth going forward. These strategic and operational successes and things we've done with an IAG over the last couple of years are flowing through to our financial performance. Our premi s have grown by around 35% since 2020. And sort of importantly, our low volatility capital light strategy has kept our prescribed capital amount relatively flat even though premi s have grown 35%. And of course we've achieved that in an evolving natural perils environment. Since 2020, we've doubled our natural perils allowance and our reinsurance costs are up 50% over the same time period. And despite these challenges, the profitability we're achieving now is consistent with our financial targets of a 15% insurance margin and a 14 to 15% ROE. And our view these targets balance the interests of all of our stakeholders of IAG In relation to the future. You know, by 2030 our view is that our population will have grown by over 2 million people across Australia and New Zealand. And of course what that means is we think there'll be 2.4 million more cars on the road, about a million more houses being built and about 300,000 more businesses created in that time. And of course that what that growth does well that'll increase the demand for our products into those markets. And what these graphs do is show the opportunity available of, of for IAG to participate in essentially the economic growth of Australia and New Zealand, which we see as a lot of upside. And behind that of course the value of the assets we're insuring will continue to increase in our view faster than GDP cars are becoming more complex, greater technology particularly on anything on the outside of a vehicle as we know. And with climate change driving an increase in extreme weather events, our role as you know as that economic shock absorber in Australia and New Zealand will continue to be even more important than whatever it is today. So you sort of put that package together by 2030, we expect Australia and New Zealand general insurance markets to have a premi pool of around about 115 billion by 2030. And so from today, what we expect sort of compound annual growth of our markets of at least 6% across home motor and commercial exper commercial insurance over that period. And in our view, it's our customer experience and efficiency initiatives that we'll talk about that will ensure that we'll continue to grow our company in a sector that in itself is gonna be growing over that period. You said a step back, the strategy of IAG is unchanged and continues to be focused around these four pillars around sort of growing our business around strengthening the underlying business fundamentals, which we've done a lot on. Of course, we're gonna continue to invest in technology and at the same time we have, and we'll continue to focus on materially uplifting the groups from risk maturity, which is an important aspect of how we run our company in terms of our approach to m and a opportunities. And as we demonstrated last week, you know, that approach is highly aligned to the strategy that we're setting out, you know, and to be sort of stating the obvious, we are only focused on businesses and customers in Australia and New Zealand. That's the focus of our strategy. As you know, these are markets we understand and where we are best positioned in our view to live our purpose and deliver value to customers, communities. And of course importantly all of our shareholders, in addition to RACQ, we do expect there'll be further opportunities in these markets as capital technology and regulation become increasingly challenging for subscale market participants in both Australia and in New Zealand. As Neil will cover, we've delivered the bulk of our retail core platform modernization program and we're already seeing the benefits of that delivery in Julie's and Amanda's business. Now we demonstrated with the A NZ partnership that we, that we put in place last year, that we can efficiently bring new partners onto that platform and we continue to refine our approach with partners in Australia and New Zealand. And what that does, of course is provide us confidence as we're gonna be integrating RACQ onto that PLA platform over the next couple of years. You know, from a strategic perspective, any partnership needs to be consistent with our Australian New Zealand brand strategies and needs to be able to fit in with those. And then financially we'll target opportunities to be EPS accretive in the first year and make sure they, they will contribute to delivering a 15% insurance margin and a 14 to 15% ROE targets. So just sort of stepping back in relation to m and a, we'll be financially disciplined in evaluating any opportunities and our capital allocation framework will, will ensure that we deliver against the targets that we've set, the combination of our businesses, deliver synergies and value sort of between our retail and commercial businesses. We can serve customers insurance needs through their different channel of choice and are well positioned to satisfy more of the insurance needs of Australia and New Zealand. We've got some of the best cons er insurance brands in the world and so I've asked Julie and Amanda to benchmark themselves against leading global retail insurers. That's the peer group I think, of our businesses in terms of commercial businesses. This has been reset when you, and we've got a much more detailed focused underwriting discipline within the culture there. The result, of course is a material uplift in the financial performance of our commercial business. And the opportunity here is to ensure this business continues to improve and is comparable to global leaders in commercial insurance, which are different to those that we're benchmarking ourselves against on for retail insurance. Behind that, of course technology is a key enabler for all of our businesses and that's why I've asked Neil to come and talk about the technology platform that we've set up and really setting ourselves up importantly for the future. So I'll stop there and hand you over to Neil. He's gonna give us a bit more color on that. Thanks Nick and good morning all. My name's Neil Morgan. I'm the Chief operating officer at IAG. I have the privilege of leading the technology and operations teams and as Nick referred to and I described at this session last year, we've been delivering back-to-back transformations now since 2018. And our focus has been on creating the foundations that unlock our growth ambition, enable outstanding customer experiences and create the level of control and efficiency that we expect of ourselves. Over the last 40 years, we acc ulated a significant amount of architectural complexity and whilst we definitely created value from those platforms, we committed to being the management team that would modernize that technology landscape. And as you're aware, our initial focus was on claims. So claims consolidation, moving to a single claims platform two years ago now, creating a foundation on which we could quickly and easily launch new features for the entire organization, including claims tracking and digital lodgement improvements. We've prioritized operational efficiency, better informing customers of their claims progress and getting customers back on the road and back into their homes faster with claims delivered. We move to retail distribution, pricing and policy management and over the last 12 months, we've had a huge delivery year for our retail businesses. We've now deployed the platform for all of our scale strategic brands and we're migrating at pace, and I'll go a little bit deeper on that in just a moment. The equivalent distribution pricing and policy system record of system of record work has now commenced for our intermediated businesses as well. We're excited about that opportunity. The opportunity also supports us delivering that for our cross Tasman businesses. We see significant growth opportunity around the ease of broker partnering and for the expense ratio improvement. And behind these customer facing transformations, we've been steadily consolidating our core operational capabilities, our risk platforms, our people and our digital workplace capabilities have been transformed. In parallel the decommissioning that these changes allow simplifies our technology landscape. It reduces risk and it improves control. And to date, we've decommissioned almost 300 assets, 289 to be precise and there's more on the roadmap as we complete our transformation streams. So to go just a little bit deeper on our retail journey, this view demonstrates why we feel we're entering a new phase now. One where our focus is on innovating on top of that transformed core, both for our customers and for our business. We've delivered a single core tech stack for our retail business and the brand coverage of that stack and those new platforms is approximately $7 billion of GWP. We've proven that it scales, we have 3 million risks live on that platform and we are migrating around 350,000 a month. So of course that hasn't been easy, but we've built a lot of muscle over the course of more than 60 releases on that program and that muscle proved very, very valuable over the last 12 months as we've gone live with our scale brands, particularly NRMA state and the a MI direct portfolios. In addition to the customer facing deployments and the experience uplifts, we've also transitioned our customer mastering solution, our finance integration. We've API enabled the architecture to support scaling. So this transformation is pretty fundamental to our future. just to give you a flavor of some of the outcomes that we've seen, we now have a single core platform with, with harmonized products and capabilities and that significantly simplifies our operations for our people. It's allowed us to build features and deploy them, so build them once and deploy them to all brands. secondly, the strategic pricing capability we've delivered has been the single biggest win through the transformation. That pricing capability is significantly more sophisticated, both in terms of the speed of making change and in the granularity of the insight that it provides. We've seen a material improvement in risk selection and pricing accuracy each time we've onboarded a brand to the enterprise platform. Third, our online and mobile app experiences have lifted that fulfills commitments where some brands previously had quite limited capability and reuse of these assets has supported some excellent app store ratings that continue today. And then finally speaking as the operational technology owner perhaps best of all, from my perspective, our retail core is far more resilient, secure cloud enabled. Those applications provide a stable foundation for us to support scale and growth. And through those changes, we've also learned a lot about bringing on partners as Nick mentioned the ability to onboard partners to that strategic solution. And we've seen that come through in the value delivered through winning the A NZ business and more recently in our confidence to support the RACQ partnership. So in terms of what's ahead, onboarding additional partners and our CTP business becomes the focus of the program for the remainder of this year and into next year. And then as we move into our next phase of value from the platform, obviously that again, that focus on innovating on top of the core, continuously improving experiences and Jill and Amanda will talk more about their growth plans shortly. We're seeing some significant upsides you'll see on the slide there. some of the improvements we've seen in digital channel share, increased conversions, the pricing improvements I described earlier. And through that, the retention of our business has remained strong, which is obviously critical. We're also in a different position around inorganic growth. as Nick mentioned and I I stated earlier, our ability to onboard partners and reuse the migration patterns is really critical to us. we're in a fundamentally different place in that respect from where we were prior to the transformation. So to switch over to intermediated, we're at a different point in our journey. but it's a journey that we know very well. So we're now in the final stages of building our first products in our target solutions and the intent is very consistent with the retail experience I just described. A simplified modern cloud enabled platform that allows us to then optimize and innovate on top of. And we're already seeing some of the value of that come through tactically in in JIRAs business. the use of gen AI for activities like ingestion of broker information and that part of our business, you know, has driven value from heritage platforms over a very long period and we recognize that we owe it to our partners to provide the best possible, most efficient and seamless experiences for them. Importantly, I think we're, we're looking at that as an opportunity. Trans trans Tasman. So we see significant upside in the reuse across AU and New Zealand, both in our package and our underwritten businesses. And from an expense perspective, this is an opportunity, a critical opportunity to remove manual work, have improved controls and and less referrals in our business, so better for us and better for our customers. Jared will talk more about the experience being enabled in a moment, but I have no doubt that this investment will ensure IAG is a simpler, stronger, more resilient business with better optionality in our intermediated space. We'll have less complex architecture. It's an opportunity to decommission more platforms and an ability to create more value from our structured and unstructured data. being that partner of choice for brokers on each of the previous slides you'll have noted the language of inclusive innovation and i's AI platform. as you're aware, we have a really long history of AI usage at IAG. we acquired a, a specialist business some 10 years ago and we kind of co-founded the Gradient Institute in 2018 to support research and guidance in the ethical use of ai. And over the last year we've been building tools under the brella of inclusive innovation. we believe that this is an enterprise topic. It's it's not about coders and engineers, it's about ensuring the value of these tools is in the hands of everyone right across our business. And of course, the timing of generative AI becoming ubiquitous and and us completing our retail platform transformation is a huge opportunity for us. So our ability to adopt these tools and innovate on top of the core is, is very different to where we were three years ago. In terms of our approach, we see the use of gen AI in three categories. we're organizing our capability and our investment around these categories. the first is deploy and the focus here is to create every bit of value possible through the use of the capability that's embedded in enterprise applications. So the most familiar to most people is Microsoft copilot, but we are working with many of our partners to understand and influence the product roadmap for how those capabilities will be deployed in their platforms that we can then get into the hands of our full workforce. The second category is where we've established a bespoke gen AI bot builder called Genie. and it's the distinction here is that it allows us to support IAG specific use cases, so focused on IAG information built rapidly at low cost addressing specific business problems or opportunities. And this is where we're driving a, a highly inclusive approach, enabling employees right across the business to benefit from this category of capability. To do that, we've trained 150 activators to support our people in building these solutions. They're across all divisions and those activators can advise and select on the right backend models. Consider the responsible reuse principles, use low-code, no-code solutions to build these solutions out, removing friction performing task faster and more efficiently. And then finally we have the composed category where we invest in deep AI capabilities and then scale them across the company. These are built by our specialist team creating custom solutions and, and we've seen some good wins in all of these categories. just to give you a feel for scale, we have over a hundred use cases now in experimentation or trial and production and the examples sort of called out on the slide. I think bring these to life. So in the teams have have used embedded tools to reduce the review effort on claims correspondence, not by little bit by 60%, but we've built an IAG specific solution to change the tone of voice across a whole, a whole s swath of marketing material and that saved us hundreds of thousands of dollars. And then finally in the composition category we've also had a big win with delivering the tool we refer to as Cassie that you'll see in a breakout session shortly with Jared and the team. So to close a few key messages from me as I hand over to Julie from a retail perspective, we're in a new world now. our focus is on driving value, innovating and supporting our growth objectives. On top of the platforms that we've deployed on intermediated, we're seeing early signs of success and now applying the capability and experiences from retail to support Jared and Amanda in taking their businesses to the next level. And then on the inclusive innovation side, we see this as a vehicle for us to adopt new capability, democratizing the use of these tools safely and creating better, more efficient experiences across our business. So thank you for your time. I'll hand you over to Julie now for a deep dive into the retail business. So good morning everyone, it's a pleasure to present to you today the update on retail insurance in Australia. My name is Julie Batch and I'm the CEO of this part of the business. And today I wanna talk to you about three things, the strength of our brands, our scale advantage across Australia and our differentiator into the future, our intent to move faster than anyone else. So to start a quick overview of retail insurance in Australia, which now comprises two businesses. So firstly our direct to customer cons er business represented by our national flagship brand, NRMA insurance and our digital native innovator Roland and our portfolio of partnerships that includes our Victorian insurance partner, RACV, and our national distribution relationships. This year our businesses will collectively write gross premi s of more than 8.3 billion and help well over 5 million Australians. So to touch on our brands next year, NRMA insurance turns a hundred years old and that today it remains the most trusted insurance brand in Australia is something that we are incredibly proud of. Roland is our innovation engine and it's currently scaling the first insurance product telematics product that is linked to insurance in Australia and it's winning value awards. We recently celebrated the 25th anniversary of our enduring relationship with RACV, one of the top 20 strongest brands in the country. And our distribution partnerships include newer relationships like a NZ and those that have stood the test of time including Bendigo Bank and People's Choice. And next time we speak to you subject to regulatory approvals, we'll include RACQ on this slide, a 25 year partnership that will last likely well beyond my tenure and possibly your own reporting. So let me recap a little bit on our progress so far. We've been on a multi-year journey to modernize our business and via our incredible brands, we are ready to accelerate into our next phase of growth. We started by rationalizing our direct brand architecture and we launched NRMA and Roland as national brands In FY 22 we simplified our products and we invested as Neil talked you through in our technology platform, we've grown our customer base to more than 5 million customers and we've maintained our financial returns. In FY 24 we focused on strengthening our business claims and supply chains were restructured and we established new distribution capability via the enterprise platform. Both major pieces of work have been successfully delivered with claim savings on motor of more than $750 per claim. And our direct business operating seamlessly on ep, the last policy actually moves across in four months time. This year we are seeing net customer growth increase again as these capabilities come to fruition and this is giving us a great deal of confidence about the future. So touching on the current operating environment, we really see it as one of opportunity. As Nick mentioned, the long-term growth prospects are strong, but we anticipate sustained segment growth across all segments that are relevant to retail and we're absolutely focused on capturing our share. Population growth is expected to be 1.4% over the coming years, which will elevate motor vehicle stock dwellings and small businesses by similar amounts and we expect inflation will continue to stabilize as normal operating conditions return across motor supply chains supported by the work that we've done rearchitecting our supply capacity and home is also moderating though at a slower pace. We know that this will help ease some of the pressure that Australians continue to feel with pricing. Our market is also highly competitive. Customers across the industry are switching at a very high frequency with 34% of them shopping their renewal around our customers have shown incredible loyalty with only 28% of them behaving in the same way. And this has helped us maintain our market leading retention rates during a really challenging time. We are always striving to help our customers when they need us the most. So to our vision, our vision is to be a help company. And this year we launched our national campaign positioning ourselves as a company that helps. First help means being there for Australians at every moment to support them to understand and protect their risk. We'll provide our customers with insights that make their worlds safer. We'll advocate for and invest in resilience, provide information that improves risk understanding, and show customers how best to protect themselves. In the breakout, Michelle Klein, our chief customer and marketing officer, will run you through a help company and the customer experience that underpins it in more detail. Our vision to be a help company is supported by three simple dynamics. So firstly, exceptional brands and partnerships through which we'll be able to access a broader set of customers and risks to support our growth. Australian made scale that delivers excellence in product pricing claims and technology from within the country and all the way across the country. And a singular focus to move faster than anyone else. And this means moving propositions to market rapidly and continuously improving our productivity through strong operating discipline across our retail business. Always keeping us ahead of the competition. I'll now step through each of these pillars in a little bit more detail. So firstly, great progress has been made evolving the customer experience delivered by our brand. Our absolute focus has been on successful delivery of the enterprise platform and with that behind us, now all our attention turns to elevating experience. On top of that through delivering fast and intuitive help that's personalized to needs and delivered through a customer's channel of choice. Our people, our frontline colleagues are already delivering high quality work through our retail call centers and branches. Improving digital to meet that level of customer service is our immediate priority. We've already simplified our quote to buy experience through enterprise platform and that's delivering a 10% increase in quote completions, elevating new business vol es, particularly in our heartland of New South Wales. And you can all see the refreshed experience on our website and in our apps. The NRMA insurance app has been downloaded by nearly 600,000 customers and that's increasing by 15,000 customers per month. Importantly, half of those customers are engaging within the app with our help hub rewards program and that means that 300,000 customers are actively engaged in risk reducing tasks that make their world safer and our insurance proposition stronger. That said, there are areas we can improve and as part of transforming tomorrow, we are building service that is quick and efficient so customers can get a quote in under two minutes. We're using AI to support our frontline colleagues and we are delivering more tailored personalized service to our customers. In particular those that have been with us for decades. In terms of our portfolio of partnerships, our perpetual relationship with RACV just celebrated its 25th year. It continues to go from strength to strength to today. RACV delivers insurance products to more than 1.3 million. Victorians distribution partners are new, however to RIA and we are evolving this segment to align it to our broader retail strategy and that's why we've brought these portfolios together. As part of phase one, we review and adjust our partnering model to drive greater efficiency. The lost ratios in our distribution relationships are really actually quite strong, but the opportunity here is to streamline the cost to serve by leveraging the efficiency of our direct business and we'll position the business for growth with new partners, selected new partners that broadly align with four key principles. Those are strong alignment to customer culture, access to markets that are beyond the reach of our direct brands, strong performance orientation and positive economics and the ability to deliver our superior product and pricing, allowing us to leverage our strong capabilities. So phase two is a selected pursuit of new partnership opportunities with brands that share our customer ethos, including motoring clubs and that give us broader expansive access to motor and home risks. The recent announcement of our alliance with RACQ is a great example of this on the basis that we progress successfully through the required approvals, the partnership with RACQ will provide us access to 1.7 million members in Queensland, adding approximately 1.3 billion of short tail motor and home premi to retail insurance, making our business a $10 billion premi business when this transaction completes. In terms of scale, there are three elements that we think are critically important and those are pricing excellence, product evolution, and a leading claims model. We've already made great progress with pricing in December, 2023, we reset our pricing strategy and it's delivering benefits. Now we expanded our modeling capability, the quality of which is already evident in our leading loss ratios. We deployed our earnings pricing engine, which is improving our ability to re estimate risk and leading to better business mix, improved pro profit and growth and we can analyze and adjust our prices in real time. Previously a process that took us at times weeks, this agility enables us to quickly respond to market signals, seize opportunities, and stay ahead of the competition. With products we've continued to simplify and make it easier for customers to understand what we offer and choose the right level of cover for them. And lastly, our next evolution of claims program, which we've previously shared with you is delivering some notable milestones include the increased visibility of claims progress through our tracker as we digitize our supply chain with more than 1 million visits to our tracker per year. Of course this takes calls outta the call center, giving our people greater opportunity to deliver good service rollout of property assessment services to drive earlier claims identification and risk identification, and to highlight prevention measures for customers, we've already delivered 10,000 property inspections including 3,700 of them done virtually. This is a great experience for customers. We've moved to AI enabled direct allocation model for motor claims and this is what's driving the 750 per vehicle reduction in cost and we've to date delivered 144 million of recurring savings of our $400 million program on track to elevate that to 200 million this year. And we're confident of reaching the $400 million claims target that we shared with you. And the final pillar of our strategy is one that we think will differentiate us and that's by moving faster than anyone else. A few years ago when I was in China just before covid, I asked many of the amazing scaled organizations that I met with what their key metric or driver was and I was surprised when every single one of them said time, actually they said 10 minutes. but their focus was on the relentless reduction on time to serve and fulfill a customer's needs. The following year when I get back, it had got back, it had halved to five minutes. So that is what is inspiring us. The need to move at speed, leveraging our scale successful delivery of the enterprise platform gives us the ability to dramatically IMO improve our digital capabilities and we are focused on a greater share of digital engagement, faster decisioning and quicker adaptability. Today, 50% of our transactions and are through digital and of course if we look at that just through an efficiency lens, the more we drive to digital, the more efficient we will be. However, we also need to ensure that our customers can be served through the channel of choice that meets their needs and often in our business that is h an to h an. And so we are also focused on that. Our claims transformation is speeding up decision making. We've already seen positive results in supply chain. Our AI allocation tools are driving 80% accuracy of repair allocations and through further iterations this is lifting to 90% and our investment in new technology to drive claims efficiency right there across our claims supply chain has delivered a 40% reduction in cycle times. The productivity benefits for us moving more quickly are vast. So in s mary, our vision is to be a help company, one that serves our customers through our exceptional brands and experiences delivers Australian made scale and moves faster than anyone else. And it's these three things that we believe will keep us ahead of the competition. It's now my pleasure to introduce Jared to share with you the progress in our intermediated portfolio. Thanks Julie. good morning everyone. I'm Jared Hill. I'm the CEO of CGU and WFI. Today I'll provide an update on the pathway forward for Intermediated Insurance Australia. Now that we have entered the next horizon of our strategy, this follows successful delivery of our 250 million insurance profit target through Horizon one. We built positive moment as we simplified our business, delivered profitable growth and improved the reputation of our brands. We have developed stronger core insurance capabilities to improve underwriting and pricing practices, establish more effective portfolio management, and laid the foundations to become a consistently high performing intermediated insurer. We have a broad portfolio of across personal lines, SME and agri commercial mid-market and corporate customers. Corporate is the smallest of these segments but has been a source of growth for CGU since FY 23. Through selective focus in targeted segments, we de we deliver products to customer across these segments through a range of intermediaries which provides optionality to shape our portfolio. Whilst, whilst maintaining scale, we've grown to generate 4.3 billion in gross written premi in FY 24 while delivering a step change in profitability. We have rebuilt the CGU brand with brokers and are increasingly being recognized as a preferred partner in WFI. We have turned around performance to the extent that we now have the confidence in this portfolio to develop WFI as a growth engine for I I A. To achieve this, I've recently strengthened the leadership capability within WFI, which I'll touch on in more detail shortly. The agency partners that we support, including NTI and SUU, provides scale and margin benefits for our business, while also helping us extend our penetration and scale in several risk classes. While I I a may not have fully realized its earnings potential in the past, we have now demonstrated the opportunity for profitable growth that exists within our business. We will remain highly selective as we manage the portfolio with ongoing margin improvement. Our priority on joining IA in 2021, we launched our three horizon strategy with the immediate aim to deliver more than 250 million insurance profit by FY 24. We exceeded this goal which reflects the underwriting pricing and cost disciplines that have been established within our business. We will not move away from these disciplines as we seek to further grow the portfolio and build market share As we have done since FY 21. I'll continue focus the business on margin growth through responsible portfolio management. I'd like to talk to some specific examples of the recent actions we have taken to improve outcomes for our shareholders, customers and partners. These examples are evidence of our ability to incrementally deliver change at the same time as we undertake broader business transformation within I I A we refer to this as perform and transform. We'll meet the goals we have set ourselves and the expectations of shareholders while finding the capacity and resources to successfully transform I A A into a market leading intermediated insurer in our workers' compensation business. We have turned around performance by creating a dedicated end-to-end team under new leadership through a focus on cost management, targeted risk selection and specialist underwriting, we established an attractive portfolio of business. A focus on underwriting practices has enabled CGU to grow in the mid-market and large commercial segment. An example is our property ISR portfolio where we're attracting profitable new business growth in this portfolio has been enabled by developing our underwriting talent pool, including acquiring external leadership and delivering a better service experience for customers and brokers. Our claims team remained focused on efficiency, responsiveness and service through process redesign and the use of technology. We are seeing evidence of this through measures that monitor customer satisfaction and internal productivity. Those with us in the room today will see a showcase of one of these technology use cases. Shortly in WFI, we have delivered pricing sophistication improve improvements within our agri book. This included transitioning our pricing functionality from the legacy WI 90 system to new technology models and algorithms in our I I A rating engine RAE. The 21 percentage point margin improvement in WFI since FY 21 is evidence of the value of this work. We believe the commercial insurance market in Australia will face continued change in the next few years driven by external factors with our broker partners deploying different strategies and technology capabilities. We believe the key attributes for a successful insurer will be agility, efficiency and service key external factors that we we will that we believe drive change include an expected softer rate environment. Further broker consolidation with new entrant driving, increased competition for talent and customers. Broad base investment in technology by brokers to support divergent strategies. A heightened focus on value that will drive productivity and cost out across the intermediated value chain and changing customer preferences requiring a wider range of digital and real time automated engagement channels. We have a really clear strategy and vision which I'll take you through now within our platform portfolios distributed via brokers, we aim to rebuild C G's market share over the medi term. SME is C G'S traditional heartland but we do not believe our current market position reflects the strength of our brand or where we want to be. We know that we must be more efficient internally to ensure we continue to offer competitively priced products. We'll also reduce frictional cost along the value chain to support the productivity and service goals of our broking partners. Through digital connectivity and real time responses leading to better customer outcomes, legacy systems currently inhibit our ability to compete as effectively as we would like. We've made strong progress around service delivery a 30 point uplift in the last 24 months and now have a pathway to achieve our medi term goals through a business transformation currently underway. This transformation includes modernizing our core systems through the commercial enablement program. We will launch our first product on this platform padlock in the fourth quarter of this financial year. Commercial enablement will also deliver capabilities that will enhance our proposition in the mid-market. Corporate underwritten lines where we require a more bespoke proposition for brokers through horizon one. We improved our core insurance capabilities through a focus on people and process. By embedding more structured underwriting practices, we are now now able to regularly assess and shape our portfolio by focusing on segments that deliver our target margin and align with our risk appetite. This can be evidence as we grow, share and increase margin in selected underwritten lines such as ISR. Further progress we'll rely on augmenting the capability of our people with modern technology systems that enable direct connectivity with our partners. Flexible product options for brokers to deliver tailored solutions to their clients more efficiently and readily accessible data insights that can be utilized internally and to share with our brokers from a margin perspective. Commercial enablement will also provide CGU with agility to scale portfolios up and down in response to performance, our risk appetite and market conditions. Modern core systems will also enable growth enabling CGU to quickly deploy new products as customer needs evolve or market dynamic shift in categories where we do not play Today I'm very proud of the turnaround, the WFI team delivered in horizon one and I believe significant upside remains. WFI offers a unique model that provides channel divers diversification for our business. Through the WFI brand, we're able to manage the end-to-end proposition delivered to customers and utilize firsthand risk selection insights that are unmatched via most other channels. With our reps aiming to walk the farm for all WFI customers, the WFI story in the coming years will be about vol e growth and maintaining current margins. I've recently brought in new sales and distribution leadership to WFI responsible for executing on our growth ambitions to grow. We'll increase the productivity of our sales representatives so they spend more time in the field meeting customer where they live and work in their local communities. We'll attract new sales representatives to bolster our presence in existing communities. Expand into new regions will create stronger alignment around growth with key existing partners such as Nutrien and the various farmers federations. While WFI faces similar technology, technology related challenges to CGU, we still see an opportunity to grow this channel as a key component of our perform objectives. WFI is also part of our transformation agenda being on the commercial enablement roadmap where we'll harmonize product pricing underwriting disciplines across both brands. We intend to develop a market leading claims capability that delivers our promise to pay for CGU and WFI customers, particularly in their time of need. In order to achieve this ambition, we must provide industry leading customer experience efficiently handle claims to opt optimize claims cost, and redesign our processes to incorporate emerging technology. We are closely tracking NPS scores and have set clear targets for the team. We monitor both monitor NPS for both customers and brokers. By utilizing data to closely monitor the performance of our claims team, we're able to leverage insights that help us proactively enhance underwriting decisions, manage response times to ensure we're meeting expectations of our customers and stakeholders. Identify opportunities for internal process improvement and operational excellence and understand the evolving needs of customers including engagement and channel of choice preferences flexibly allocate capital and funding to deploy technology around use cases that deliver the highest ROI In horizon one, we exceeded our target to deliver two 50 million insurance profit from a solid earnings base. Today we're now in the early stages of transforming I I A into Australia's leading intermediated insurer. I'm conscious of the challenge we face to succeed. We must manage the change associated with transformation for our people, absorb the cost of core platform modernization while meeting our financial goals and navigate portfolio performance as we enter a transitional commercial insurance market to be successful. Over the medi term we'll become more agile and innovative in the way we engage with brokers and customers while maintaining strong underwriting discipline driven by data based analytics and decisions we are committed to continuing to deliver margin improvement and this remains my primary focus. I'm optimistic about the opportunities head for IA and confident we deliver against our plans. With that, I'll now pass to Amanda Whiting for an update on New Zealand. Thank you. Thanks Jared and Tenco two car Cara. Today I am really delighted to be able to share with you an update on New Zealand's strategy. I feel really confident about the direction in which we are heading and we've made great strides in the delivery of our strategy over the last 18 months. We are the market leader in New Zealand, serving in one one, sorry, serving one in every two households and a MI and state are the first and third largest direct brands. We are the trusted brand for three of the largest banks also and in the intermediated market, NZI is building on its legacy of over 165 years to be the leading brand for brokers that gives us tremendous reach and scale and our opportunities to reach new customers and deepen our relationship with existing customers. We'll do that by utilizing our connected ecosystem to support customers beyond insurance, remove pain points and connect them via one mobile app. Now just briefly reflecting on our journey so far, I've been in the role since July 21 and it was clear to me at that time that the opportunity here is to maintain and grow our insurance business, but we also had the brands and the vol es to to expand our adjacency services And over the last three years we've expanded the offering well beyond collision repair and demonstrated we can deliver an exceptional customer experience at lower cost. We built confidence in our ability to execute on this connected ecosystem strategy and I'll talk more about that shortly. Over the last couple of years, we've also faced into some challenging external operating conditions and I'm proud to say that we've led the market in our response to the Cyclone Gabrielle and Auckland flood events of 2023. We also moved really quickly to uplift our pricing capability to enable more granular risk-based pricing and respond to inflationary pressures. It's important to say though that those events have not distracted us. We've continued to make solid progress on delivering our transformation and the pace of our delivery model has accelerated and we are now dropping new capabilities every week. So looking forward to the operating environment over the next five years, we forecast that there's positive system growth in the one to 2% range per ann . And while our population is aging compared to other OECD countries, New Zealand will still have one of the lower average ages at 38 by 2030. And that's important because the younger cohort are still growing their asset base, which leads to higher insurance needs in the insurance landscape. On the commercial side, we're entering a softer cycle with an inflow of offshore capital and more managed general agencies launching in New Zealand to address that NZI will continue to execute strong underwriting discipline. We'll use our long tenure relationships and deep expertise in the market to make sure that we can trade on the value that we bring and not just the price. Looking at future customer trends, we know that customers expectations of a seamless and satisfying digital experience will be non-negotiable. By 2030, nearly half of our population will come from the millennial Gen Z and Gen Alpha cohorts and the majority of customer interactions will occur on mobile platforms. So continually investing in the digital platform by our own mobile apps is an absolute must for us. We have a mobile app experience in market today and it's currently the only general insurance app in New Zealand and we'll continue, continue to build that out with our customer offerings via the app to retain that market leading position. So what does all that mean for our New Zealand business? Well, our ambition is to become a connected customer business beyond insurance. We've got strong brand loyalty today, but we know that insurance is a low engagement product, so we're constantly paying attention to that. We are shifting from offering insurance with limited touch points to a connected business offering multiple services and these need to meet customers' needs, offer outstanding customer experiences, engage with customers more frequently and more meaningfully, and help deepen those customer relationships and reach new customers. And of course that will all result in higher retention levels. More items per customer and more customers joining us via non-insurance services. Alongside increased brand consideration, our strategies, strategies strategy's gonna be delivered by our two distinct retail brands, our connected ecosystem and our strong reputation through our NZI brand. All enabled by our continued transformation. And I'll just take you through each of the components of that strategy. So we've got strong brands offering distinctive proposition in market amongst cons ers. We're seeing a real bifurcation of needs between those being really highly price sensitive and those customers still wanting differentiated value. And for us, owning two large direct retail brands of a MI and state allows us to appeal to different customer groups while still retaining scale efficiency. A MI is our full service brand offering. It has premi personalized services, it has a full suite of insurance products from mainstream to niche and has a range of highly relevant adjacent services from our A MI hubs alongside a new loyalty reward recognition and engagement PLA platform to make sure that our customers connect all of our insurance and a MI hub service offerings together for customers state will be the simplifier focusing on straightforward low cost insurance that's just easy to understand, easy to purchase and offers a best in class digital experience and we're already demonstrating success. So a MI won the s of general insurer of the year a couple of weeks ago and state won the CANSTAR best value car insurance award as well as the overall car insurer of the year award this year. As I said before, we're continuing to expand beyond insurance and are building out our connected ecosystem, which is led by the A MI brand. And this year we've branded all of our physical assets to a MI In effect. We have around 800 moving and fixed bill billboards and they're everywhere. We're providing approximately $30 million of marketing benefit annually and every business in the ecosystem is about delivering an outstanding customer service and Wayne will be sharing more on that in our A MI ecosystem showcase shortly. In addition to deepening relationships with existing insurance customers, we're also offering standalone propositions to build connections with non-insurance customers. Earlier this year we launched a MI roadside rescue to all New Zealanders and most recently our new driver promotion of offering a free year of roadside rescue to all new license holders in New Zealand that will bring those new drivers into our ecosystem. As we look forward, we'll continue to expand our presence and the breadth of services that we offer here, but they'll all be housed in that 1:00 AM I mobile app, allowing for customers to connect with us for all their needs in one location. Moving now to N-Z-I-N-Z-I is the leading commercial insurer in New Zealand, underpinning this as strong and long lasting relationships with our broker partners and increasingly with customers and that's to support brokers and add value in that corporate market. Secondly, we're continuing to deliver and invest in our leading claims experience. It's a crucial time for customers and a real strength of the broker model. We we're continually innovating our processes and digital offerings through greater empowerment, empowerment of brokers so that they can speed up their claim and utilizing digital lodgement connectivity and AI to enable faster and more consistent decision making. A key differentiator for NZI are the assurance propositions that really help our customers reduce their risk and that's a win-win for everyone. Our commercial transport offering fleet fit is accessed by almost a third of our corporate book and our electrical inspector service is in its second year and we've already identified 2,700 electrical defects and reduced the risk for 300 businesses. We also provide up guard to customers to help detect vulnerability to cyber losses and we're continually looking for ways to support brokers and customers reduce risk through our assurance propositions. Our aspiration for 2030 is to have a modern platform leading data capabilities and AI capabilities to support, to support brokers so that they are efficient, connected and we've got improved pricing and underwriting for the customer. We'll maintain and grow our leadership position here by delivering this in tranches over the next five years. Finally, New Zealand is making good progress in the delivery of our transformation. It's all about improving customer experience and delivering efficiency benefits. We have over 360,000 policies on the enterprise platform across state, a MI and two of our four bank partners. And one of the key benefits of enterprise platform is the pricing capability uplift. And we are already evidencing improved new business quote conversions and better risk selection that we'll continue to optimize. But that's only the beginning because we'll continue to see more uplift in our digital capability as we optimize the end-to-end customer experience journeys and embed ai, we're already demonstrating the benefits of being on that single modern platform that Neil talked about for claims and we've reduced customer pain points. We've automated over 80,000 thousand man hours and we've created AI pilots from that single platform. We've also been able to introduce claims process optimization such as through our segmented claims program and that's reduced the time taken to close simple claims. So previously it took us 28 days on average and now over 80% are closed in less than three days. The n ber of customer interactions required in now down and customers are acknowledging this with our customer PS scores. They're sitting above 60 and they're actually getting better every week, which is exceptionally high by financial service standards. In the last year, NZ has made significant progress on building one unified data ecosystem that provides us with a single view of customer data really is the key to success in this strategy and it enables a deeper understanding of our customers so that we can deliver personalized engagement and connected experiences seamlessly across all touchpoints. Our single data platform accelerates our ability to deploy AI across the business. And some examples already imply are a knowledge management tool, which is help helping agents check eligibility against our policy statement or our image capture tool, which is enabling desk-based assessment versus the physical visit by an assessor. And that results in a faster claims experience and reduce cost. In addition to ai, we've also got new machine learning tools such as a predictive model to help us identify customers who might churn and that enables us to proactively respond to that. And we've seen a significant acceleration in our transformation delivery in the last 18 months. This moment is going to grow as we continue new to invest in digital data and ai and we built new skills and capabilities in the business. We're driving cultural change and we have a pathway for an ZI to modernize our intermediated business. In s mary, IAG has a unique leadership position in New Zealand that business is achieving strong results as we deliver on our connected customer strategy. And as we look forward to 2030, we'll build our data and AI capabilities, continue to digitize our business, deliver a leading claims experience, provide a range of assurance services, support customers through climate transition, and that's all in the service of connecting and growing our customer base. So thank you very much for listening to all our business updates. That brings us to the end of those, but I'm now, I've now got the wonderful job of giving you instructions for how to move downstairs to see our showcases. So we're going to move downstairs for those online. We'll be pausing our webcast and we'll res e at 1130. And that will be for an update with our CFO William McDonald. And that'll then be followed as Nick said, by a q and a session with all of our speakers. So for everyone here in the room, we'll now head downstairs, you've got a name tag, and on that you'll see you're split into two groups. Everyone for the blue group, that's group one. You'll start with the customer experience showcase. And for the purple group group two, you'll start with the Innovation showcase and there'll be people around to guide you. So thank you. Hello everyone, and welcome back to those watching on the webcast. Everyone here has just seen our showcases on customer experience and innovation. if you are online and are interested in these topics, then please contact our investor relations team. I'll start today by discussing our strong capital foundations, which are of course anchored by our robust target capital ranges as a multiple of regulatory capital minim levels, and by our approach to capital allocation, which I will speak to shortly. As a result of our approach to capital management, we've been able to invest in our technology. We've seen an upgrade to our s and p credit rating, and we've been able to return surplus capital to shareholders via on market buybacks. Our overall capital approach is to have a capital platform that's diversified by counterparty duration and type of capital, and with a mix of reinsurance equity and debt in managing hybrid capital, we actively monitor opportunities to allow us to refinance ahead of any call dates. Our diverse range of reinsurance, in particular, has allowed us to reduce earnings, volatility, and capital requirements. I've illustrated on this slide, our capital efficiency over the last 10 years, Despite an uptick due to the business interruption provision in FY 21, the trend of prescribed capital to GWP has declined from around 25% in FY 15 to approximately 15%. Now, this has been driven by i's innovative reinsurance arrangements, the original whole of account quota share deals provided the foundation for us to agree the long-term perils volatility protection in June. Of course, it's not just shareholders that benefit from this cover, it'll also provide greater certainty over the cost of, of natural perils cover for our customers. Turning to strategic capital allocation, we have a disciplined focus on allocating capital to achieve higher and more stable returns. This includes how we enhance capital efficiency and reduce volatility, and how we selectively redeploy any capital we release through these activities and capital that we generate organically on our journey to progressively reduce earnings volatility. I'm keen to explore our next best step in applying i's capital Lights strategy. I've examined the various divisions for their capital intensity and earnings volatility. I I a essentially, our commercial insurance business in Australia currently has the highest capital intensity in our group relative to retail. It, it's got a good, it's got quite a, a modest capital intensity relative to other commercial insurers. and this is despite the, it, its, its, its intensity is a little bit higher despite the capital benefit of the adverse development cover on long tail reserves that we purchased in June. And despite our strong underwriting expertise, I a A also has higher earnings volatility due to the inherent variability of large commercial losses compared with retail. Accordingly, we are considering how to apply alternative capital and reinsurance structures to i i a as the next opportunity to reduce the overall group volatility. This work will leverage the separate license that we're currently working on, which facilitates our supplying tailored approaches. In terms of deploying capital, we allocate capital selectively to support growth, to invest in technology to transform the business. And from time to time we invest in m and a as we demonstrated with RACQ, we have a disciplined approach to inorganic acquisitions. Any transaction must be strategically aligned and deliver our financial hurdles as Nick described earlier. Importantly, we want to minimize the balance sheet impact and not add significant goodwill to the balance sheet. We demonstrated last Thursday that our strong capital position allowed us to fund the RACQ acquisition without the need for an equity raise. On this slide, I've shown the pro forma capital position at 30th of June. It includes the $150 million benefit from the perils volatility protection, which has now been recognized by a PR and also the 37 million in on market buybacks that we completed year to date. The RACQ acquisition will impact our CET one by an estimated 21 points, leaving us comfortably within our target CET one range of N 0.9 to 1.1 times. It's important to note that the pro forma capital position is as at last year end, and so does not recognize any benefit from our strong FY 25 earnings to date. We also have other sources of capital generation from the utilization of tax losses and a possible future release from the $380 million business interruption provision. Turning to expenses, I'll unpack for you some of the moving parts. There are pressures on our cost base, primarily from technology and the investments we're making to support future growth. These will be offset by process and efficiency benefits, reducing the proportion of premi s that it takes to maintain and run IAG and allowing us to invest more in growth transformation and customer initiatives. As you've heard today, the management team has a strong focus on improving efficiency and productivity. For example, Neil detailed our consolidated technology and how automation via our fleet of bots is being employed throughout the organization. Julie talked to product simplification and the growth in digital interactions and how now more than 30% of claims are lodged digitally. Jared described how he's applying gen ai, including Cassie, which you saw in the showcase and how he's tackling the vol e of manual service queries, seeking to have 50% of inquiries serviced digitally. And Amanda mentioned the reduced time to close simple claims where previously it took on average 28 days. Now over 80% are closed into three days or less. And these are just a few examples. Over the last 12 months, we've worked hard to entrench an organization wide focus on productivity improvements. We have over 200 claims and cost reduction initiatives identified and scheduled across IAG that are either being delivered now or in our plans for the next couple of years. We now have greater granularity and strong rigor in tracking the financial outcomes, giving confidence in delivering the benefits. As a result of this, we anticipate a reduction in our expense ratio. Specifically the administration ratio on an X levy basis was steady in FY 24 at 11.9% and we expect this to reduce to under 11% in FY 27. In terms of capitalized costs, they're likely to continue in a similar range as we transition activity from enterprise platform to the commercial enablement program. And finally, on FY 25 guidance, we are reaffirming our GWP growth and insurance profit and margin ranges. Looking at the performance for the financial year to date, perils have been favorable to allowance, but we maintain the full year ass ption of 1280 $3 million for now. Importantly, we are seeing inflation trends stable or moderating while home inflation is broadly holding steady in Australia, motor inflation has moderated to around mid single digit while the experience in New Zealand has materially subdued and the combination of inflation and frequency across the book is running at a low single digit level. Premi rate trends across the board reflect these movements, ensuring we stay disciplined and maintain our margins in line with our targets into FY 26. Overall, we remain confident in the outlook and being able to deliver our through the cycle insurance margin and ROE targets. On that note, let's head into q and a and I'll ask my colleagues to join me here on the stage. It's Andrew from Macquarie. just a couple of questions. I suppose I'll start with William. in particular on the expense ratio slide point to point, let's say that's a hundred basis points odd improvement in the administration ratio X levies. but on the next slide, you've maintained you through the cycle margin guidance. Where's that a hundred basis points going? Thanks. Yeah, that's right. So we, we talked about so two things. One is we talked about being able to invest more in, in technology and transformation and customer, but that's, that's taken account of in in that reduction. But it's important for us to be competitive to keep prices keen for customers. and of course, you know, staying competitive helps us to with our growth ambitions as well. So we are absolutely committed to our through the cycle margin levels. and, and that that's how that works. And then a follow up question to that, how much of that ratio improvement is actually coming from absolute cost out compared to some form of mixed benefit that's coming from the integration of RACQ, which I imagine would have a mix towards a lower ratio as well. So how much is cost out and how much is mixed from RACQ? Thanks, I, all, all of all of that is from the the, the, the, the sort of examples we described and, and the the cost out program that we're managing. So that's not that's not off the back of RACQ. Yeah, None of it's, none of it's are. Thank you. Hi fre Kong from Bank of America. Sorry, just to follow up on the previous question, a hundred bips of saving, is that going to be reinvested in a more competitive loss ratio? yes. Okay. Thank you. and then how do I think about m and a versus, or how should we think about m and a versus capital return to shareholders in terms of that stacking order? 'cause you said, I guess the hurdle is just EPS secretion from year one. Yeah, I mean, pretty much the way we, we tried to set it out today around, you know, we're looking for, you know, we wanna continue to grow the business for various reasons, you know, sort of regulatory technology costs, reinsurance costs. It does seem like there's a n ber of small insurers in Australia and New Zealand that, that are looking to, to do something different. and so there are definitely opportunities available. and so for us then it's the doesn't doesn't make sense strategically, we've got a very strong bias to retail insurers in, in this, in this discussion. So then sort of that, so the first point's really important strategically, does it make sense? How does it fit with what we've already got? And then secondly, the financial discipline of you know, what does that, what does it do to the sort of the, the financials of IAG, that EPS secretion, that sort of 15% insurance margin, 14, 15% ROE, we're gonna be very fixated on, on, on that as well. And then, then it's, then it's a trade. I mean, part of this is obviously also availability because opportunities just don't, there's not that many opportunities. so we have to, every time, you know, we think about something, we sort of go strategic lands as well as that financial lens. And then, you know, we make a call like we've just done with RACQ. So I'm, I'm guessing there's a lot of flexibility in how you look at it throughout the year, or do you sort of build up a treasure chest of, of capital and then assess at the end of the year? Yeah, I, I don't think of ourselves as, as sort of running a, a chest like that. you know, we, you know, we're gonna be disciplined with our capital management. I think we've, we've shown that that we have capital targets that we're going to, to run the company to, I mean, I can't see this happening, but, you know, for some unlikely event, something large turned up that we, we needed to go and talk to shareholders we could. So that doesn't trouble us that point. and we're certainly not in the business of sort of building up bigger and bigger war chest for, for opportunities. We're gonna be disciplined with how we, how we think about this and, you know, manage the capital in the targets that we've set out. Thanks Ki and should you UBS just coming back to the expense Im improvements across the group divisionally, where do you still see the greatest opportunity from here In, in, in Divisionally? Yep. Definitely within Jared's. Yep. I mean, I think Jared's talked about that. I mean, he's, we've, we, we have a under-invested commercial business for some time. We've done, you know, as Jared stepped through quite a lot of change already. But there's, you know, there's, it's a, it's an opportunity. this sits, sits in front of us for the next couple of years. And Jared, you touched on sort of a softening commercial pricing backdrop, and I think Amanda mentioned it in New Zealand as well. Are you confident sort of the desire to see margins increase from here, that there's enough cost opportunity, even if we see pricing shift below inflation, that, that you can deliver mar margin upside from here? Yeah, well, we're certainly not seeing cost the, sorry, the market rate drop below inflation at the moment for our commercial business. so we're still getting rate increases through the portfolio on average, across the portfolio as of the end of Q1. so to me it's still a rational market, but it's clear it's a market in transition and we won't have another year of rate increases of, as we've seen in the past, it'll happen in pockets. the investments we've made in our sort of pricing sophistication, portfolio management, they'll be tested through a soft market cycle. So I guess the proof will be in the next three years of delivering that. Am I confident? Yes, I am confident in the investments we've made and the capabilities we've built that puts us in a strong position to manage our way through the cycle. Excellent. Do you wanna make a comment, John, comment on, I I just quickly, I mean, I think we are seeing the market soften a little faster than Australia. similar to Jared though, we're still seeing that, you know, we, that the rates are holding and you know, we've, we've got similar opportunities. We are looking at our pricing capability, we're building out tactical solutions now which will fill the gap until we have a more strategic solution. Yep. Thanks. And just a last question. I think, William, you touched on sort of motor inflation moderating, but home stable. Julie, can you just maybe talk to what level of inflation you're seeing across home and sort of what, what is driving that stickiness in in that book? Sure. So in with home in Australia, we're still sort of seeing that with low double digit inflation. There's probably some signs of that abating a little bit more than that. but we're being quite cautious at the moment. The drivers just continue to be the cost of trades, the availability of some building materials, and it's improving in pockets, but there are some parts of the country where those costs are still reasonably high. I think over the next couple of months as we move through the first part of, you know, the storm season, we we'll feel more confident about the outlook on property. Thank you Permission from JP Morgan. A couple of questions if I can. One, just on the slide on expenses  slide 56 just in there you provided a breakdown of the different components of your compensation. It looks like the grow component is increasing very significantly starting from this year. I just wanna be clear, is that the marketing budget and are we saying that you're gonna be doubling that within the next couple of years? Is that, is that how I should be interpreting that slide? It's, it's, it's more than just marketing. I mean, it, there's, there's other, there's other capabilities and digital investment and so on that are, that are that are part of that as well. But yeah, it's important. I mean, we, we, we, we talk about growth it, it's, it's a focus for us and, and we look forward to you know, bringing down cost to maintain, but, but being able to invest a bit more in that. Yeah. Maybe just carrying on on that theme, Nick, I think you, you, you mentioned growth was a focus of yours 18 months ago, I think you mentioned it again at the last result, just, just want, but there wasn't really a lot today in terms of any n bers around what you're targeting. Could you just help us understand how you being you know I suppose assessed on growth and what your targets are, particularly in the personalized? Yeah, I mean we still, I mean, just going back to that expense comment just to, to see what we're trying to do is have productivity efficiency to fund what we're doing. And so, you know, we we're sticking to the 15% margin. We want to create ourselves more room to be able to invest back into the business, to then to create, you know, sort of that growth engine happening throughout the, particularly the retail businesses. And when we put some targets out there around sort of growing the business by a million customers you know, over a period of time. And we've, we we're still very focused on that. I mean, that's not, I mean that's, we're not adding RACQ to that sort of did that in one one bite, but that's in addition to RACQ. So the sort of the, the timelines and the way we'd sort of stepped that out. and yet, you know, yet the last 18, 12 18 months was quite tough for us. We had serious inflation that we had to, to manage our business through. We were doing quite a lot of pricing remediation as, as, as everyone here is aware of. And we've sort of got the business operating at, you know, roughly the margins we wanna run the business at. and so I, you should expect to see a little bit more customer growth come through at December, and that's, that that sort of plan over the next couple of years is still the plan in relation to how we being rewarded call that. I mean that is an element. I mean, we've got a heavy financial element in the way this group is being rewarded sort of just on absolute earnings, margins return on capital, but growth is also an element of that. And so we're not walking away from some of those targets we set a year or so ago, which a couple of years ago. and you know what I would like to, I think that we've had a lot of resetting of the company that's occurred over the last couple of years and, and it's hard for us to explain what it's like to re-platform, you know, essentially two thirds of the company. And that's, that, that's probably been a bigger exercise than we originally thought. and you know, it takes a lot of our time and that we've kind of got that running now. And so maybe with hindsight, the amount of effort required to make that happen, we probably slightly underestimated the thing now is we've got it. And so now you can tell by our language the acquisition of RACQ. So the confidence is up now about what that, what opportunity that now presents us going forward. So Sid, I'd like to think that over the next 12, 18, 24 months, you're gonna see customer n bers and particularly in our retail businesses, you know, grow. Just one final question. when you announced the RACQ business, we didn't, we didn't get a chance to ask many questions around it. There were, we were lacking detail on you know, the profitability of exactly the bits that yeah, you were buying the, the reason for the structure, which was not a full, you know long term distribution arrangement and, sorry, not a permanent distribution arrangement, it's a 25 year arrangement. and just you know, what happens at termination, if you could just help Yeah, fill us, fill us in on some of those details. Yeah, sure. And I mean, part of that, just sort about the way it was, 'cause we knew what we were doing today, so we put out a pack and we did a few calls, but we knew we were gonna be able to talk to everyone today. So we, we welcome any, any questions on that too? sort of sort of breaking that down. So the club exists as the club going forward so that, so you know, we, we've done a partnership with the insurance company and the insurance proposition to RACQ, the brand and the, the rest of the, the, the member organization continues to be owned by the member organizations. We've just bought the insurance company within that. so if you think about us, we've got three different arrangements like that now. We've got the NMA, which was a demutualization and separation of the insurance company and the member organization, and we now share a brand, and that's kind of unusual. We have RACV, which was a DA transaction where we were the mutual, it's pretty close to RACQ except the distribution deal is in perpetuity and it's a 70 30 JV in perpetuity. I mean that, that's probably a bit unusual now to have a joint venture in perpetuity. I would've thought what we've done with RACQ is probably a more normal structure where we've done, you know, there's integration costs, there's set ups, there's all sorts of things we sort of wanna be all in on this. So we've done what we think is a pretty long term transaction, 25 years. So there's no one sort of thinking, how are we gonna exit this? It's all about this is forever. That's how we're thinking about it. so that, so that, you know, the perpetuity versus 25 years, I think practically a 25 year would be more of a normal type arrangement. Perpetuity is unusual. I think two, it's not like RACV. So yes, we ha we are, we announced that we bought 90% on day one, but we have a fixed price option. And that fixed price is the metrics that we announced last week to buy the remaining 10% at our call in two years time. So we we're essentially gonna be a hundred hundred percent owner of that business after two years. and then the nature of the way it works is actually very similar until you come in to how we operate with RACV, where the distribution is done by the club, the product, the manufacturer, the pricing, the claims management is all done by us. And obviously we're partnering this wonderful brand, you know, the strongest brand in that market with the capability scale capital of IAG and sort of partnering that up for the 1.7 million members of, of Queensland. So sort of it's, it feels like a, a pretty sort of logical tie up in my mind with a wonderful brand distribution and, and sort of the capability from us bringing that together as an opportunity. But, Oh yeah, I'll just make a a small additional comment. I think just in the way we've structured the transaction, it's really about delivering a great experience to the members of RACQ. So it's very important to RACQ that their membership kind of embraces this opportunity and understands the change. And similarly, it's really important for us that those members are transitioned across to this experience you know, as holistically as possible. And so the structure is really around sustaining that membership engagement. And we've worked really closely with RACQ on that. They're very proud of their membership base, you know, they're loved in Queensland. and that's, we've really tried to, to work in, in a way that's going to maximize the portfolio going forward. Sorry, there are just two other parts of the question. Just what happens at the end? who keeps the customers, when the relationship ends? Do, do they remain with the with you or do they remain with the, I mean, do they go with the RACQ business? And the other question is just the profitability of home and motor for RACQ. How is it different? Profitable? Yeah. At the, at the termination arrangements after 25 years, it's a long way away. Sure. maybe we'll just generalize. I think we just generalize on that because part of that is part of the way we've negotiated the deal and there's a n ber of other transactions on the go at the moment as people aware of, I mean, I'd just say we're comfortable at the end of the term that, that we'll be in a reasonable position. That's probably as far as I would go. I would go. I would say though that this arrangement has been structured in a way whilst it's got a 25 year duration, it's structured in a way that contemplates perpetuity. Yeah. And our absolute intent is that this is a long term transaction that endures well beyond that time period. I think that's how you should be thinking of it. I mean, that's what I would expect. And just on sit on profitability and the run rate of that business before any synergies is probably a combined ratio of sort of mid to low nineties across the Homer Motor book. So it's, it's, it's quite a lot of change that's happened there. I mean they had a CTP book that, that they, and many others have had some real problems with. They've, they've exited that out of their run rate or exit outta their business. we know the cyclone pools come in and so that sort of facilitated some of their perils pricing and the like. and so we, we, we sort of think, we sort of feel like we're buying that, that that business at about that type of run rate. And then what we're able to do, and this is why it's, it's sort of in my mind, a natural fit for us. We get some, some pretty strong reinsurance synergies that are sort of a big part of it over the first couple of years. and then, you know, what we'll be then doing is integrating, and that's why it's not part of the, the 11% at this point. you know, as then we'll be integrating onto the platform we've built, bringing that business on. So what we expect to do, we're actually buying a licensed vehicle, that licensed vehicle over the first, you know, we'll, we'll, we'll aim to, to, to move that, remove that, essentially put it into the main IAL entity of IAG and then put it onto the, as part of that process, sort go onto the enterprise platform. And so it'll be integrated into the retail business. One last thing, we talked about this with members last Thursday when we were in Brisbane. We're definitely going to reopen the discussion around Queenstown, Queenstown, Queensland, CTP that we exited that so have they, the, the regulator. And we've said we would like to be part of that, but we need scheme reform that she spoke to the, to the regulator on Thursday and, and said that to them directly. And so, you know, that's sort of a, a work in progress for us because we like the idea with some reform happening for us to reenter that market that'll be good for RACQ members. 'cause we would reenter it under the RACQ brand with us being the manufacturer. So that's, so that's, we haven't factored that in, but that's sort of in, in our, in our minds an opportunity. It feels like the regulator is gonna want to have a scheme with, with more market participants that is than what's currently there. And so, I mean, I, I think that's likely to happen over the next 12, eight months. Hi guys. Thanks for taking out questions. just a first one, in terms of just the, the rate increases in the RACQ portfolio, can you maybe talk a bit about how that's been trending over time and expectations from here? And then also just the retention, how that's been tracked? I know you've given us one data point there, but keen to understand how that's been trending. Yeah, I mean, you mate, so it's, it's a extremely well loved brand in Queensland and so it has many, many characteristics similar to what we see with NRMA. So that's a high level, but Julie, Yeah, I mean I think the, the RACQ book, like every book in Australia of home and motor has gone through transformation in terms of price. what I, what we've looked at over the last period of time has been the work they've been doing similar to us in supply chain, particularly around motor. And they've done some great work there in terms of managing inflationary costs. in terms of home, there's similar experiences that we're all experiencing. There's not specific company issues, they're broad industry-wide issues. and so what we are seeing is, you know, pricing kind of following those trends and moving, you know, abating as well with those trends. As Nick said, we are confident in the delivery of that sort of, you know, low nineties combined over time. And you know, that that's part of the reason we're bringing a home and motor book into a home and motor book. So we feel we are pretty confident about that. So, so what you're saying there is you, you're comfortable with the level of pricing Yeah. Price adequacy and you're comfortable, you, so there's no, there's not gonna be an acceleration in pricing under your stewardship At the moment. We're pretty comfortable in what we've seen in terms of the price levels and so on. And I think the opportunities, as Nick said, are in how we manage the portfolio around technology, capital and so on as being where we can bring a different way of thinking about a book that's gonna help the customer and help the member. Okay. No, that makes sense. and then maybe just on the sort of 21 basis points of capital impact, what exactly does that ass e in terms of reinsurance structures on the RACQ portfolio? so yeah, just interested in the breakup there between what you're paying and the capital benefit that you've ass ed. Yeah, William. Yeah, I don't, I don't think I want to go into into great specifics there, but you know, we, we, we, we do expect that that over time, the, the, the, the reinsurance the type of reinsurance structures that we have for the group will be of benefit for RACQ you know, relative to, to what they have now. And so, sorry, so what's exactly, what, what did they have now? Is it just a 35% quarter share? Is that Yeah, and, and the, and the CAP program, And I think it's really important, you know, this is a business that's continuing to operate. We've gotta go through some approval processes. And so in terms of their specifics, obviously they're buying standalone reinsurance for Queensland and that can be really difficult at times. So in terms of being able to absorb that into a much bigger portfolio, that's where our benefits come from. And, and that's been our playbook when we've been, you know, taken on other portfolios in the past that, that you should ass e that a generalization that they would then fit within the overall structure. the, the individual license entity, we can look through that for the purpose of reinsurance. So we don't, we don't need to have done that integration onto our platform, moved into IAL to to, because we already buy reinsurance that covers multiple license entities across Australia and New Zealand. So we can effectively access that opportunity straight away. And, and then just the last question for me in terms of the, the comment around investing in, in loss ratios just for growth which is offsetting some of the expense benefits correct me if I'm wrong there, but just to understand, where, where are you seeing potential pressure where rates may start to be running below inflation? Which classes a business, where is it getting more competitive that you may need to be competing on price to, to grow? I mean, maybe it's a comment for, for each of the, each of the businesses to, to, to maybe Julie, then Jared and Amanda. Sure. So inflation is still tracking. we're not in a deflationary environment yet. I would say. I think we've talked a lot about the cost of motor repairs becoming more expensive with different types of parts, different types of technology in the vehicles and so on. so, so we're still seeing inflation in the book. It's just nowhere near the levels that it was in the past. There's always competition in this market. It's particularly prevalent in motor. and that's why we've done so much work rearchitecting all of our supply chain, you know, looking at our claims processes and really making sure that we're as efficient as we can be. So a lot of our digital investments go into that space that allow us to, to bring claims costs down so we can pass that to customer. we see lots of discounting on, on first year of business and, you know, that does concern us. That's not something that IAG does. and when, but, but once that goes through a 12 month cycle, we see those customers return as their second year premi hits them. And so, you know, we, we kind of just need to make, we, we're trying to make sure that we ride the cycles through, that we deliver as an efficient product as we possibly can. and we are comfortable that we're set up to do that in the right way. And just on the intermediated business we don't look, we don't look to that for the for the growth to drive growth in our business. Ours will be about where we see there's margin opportunity and we'll write the business at the price that delivers that margin broker personal lines. we, we look to manage that and, and price that to margin. and so we are, we are looking, we work closely with Julie and understanding what the inflation claims inflation looks like, and we ensure that we we're getting adequate price and deliver a fair price to market. Yeah, and, and I think in New Zealand, in the, our personal lines market, we're certainly not, we're seeing home slightly lower than, than Australia in terms of inflation rates, and that's driven by a few things. It's not the sort of public spending that we are seeing in Australia. So the availability of trades and supply is actually okay. I, I, I would expect that we would sort of keep ahead of inflation over the next year with very low single digit increases across both portfolios. Where it's most obvious is probably the motor space. It's similar to Julie. And we have, you know, all the work that we're doing around supply chain and ensuring that we're keeping those repair costs low, so we can pass that back to the customer. Hi there, Simon from Jefferies. just a real quick question. On the $50 million of savings around the reinsurance program on the RACQ, does that ass e that it'll be included in your long-term perils volatility program? do you have to get permission, obviously from Berkshire Hathaway and your other partners, whether you've already done so, and what addition would that cost just for that particular part of the portfolio, if you had any sort of comments to make around that? Yeah, well, I mean we, we've as you can imagine you know, we, we, we've been speaking to our reinsurance partners at least had, had, had initial conversations. and, and, and one way to think about it is, is you know, if you look at the, the geographic geographic diversification that IAG has across different regions of Australia and New Zealand we were underweight in Queensland and this sort of fills out that part. So, so there's, you can see there's a natural, there's a natural benefit to us relative to Queensland standalone for bringing this in. but I, I don't think I want to go much further than that just for now. I, I think we should say that we would have a similar apply a similar reinsurance philosophy and strategy to this book as we do to our whole portfolio, and we'll work really closely with our reinsurance partners as we progress over the next sort of six to 12 months to find the best structures that help us deliver that. it's also really important that we respect the reinsurance partners of RACQ. They're very similar to ours. but you know, they've done a lot of work with that business for a long period of time and they, you know, they're still working there. So Thank, thank you. to Anthony, who at CLSA can I ask the first question just on the RACQ transaction? you talked about the transaction aligning with your 14, 15% insurance margin. Can you talk about how far away the business is from that margin at the moment? I mean, are we talking sort of next 12 months or are we talking sort of three, five years or? Oh, No, no. I mean, we've, I mean, I'm, we, you know, the run rate we're saying that we're targeting IAG to deliver about a 15% margin, 14 to 15% ROE. That's our sort of financial profile. I mean, bring, and then we've said this, this transaction will be EPSA created day one to IAG, and I would expect that we'll be operating at that 15% insurance margin, 14 to 15% ROE, you know, in the, in the first year. partly because bringing sort of the, sort of the, what William's been talking about that, that, yes, we've got an, we're sort of almost, we've got a few different layers here. We've got day one just start, just to be clear, everyone at one January and our renewals, our, our reinsurance, none of this impacts it. So sort of business as usual at IAG well, obviously we're contemplating what this could look like, but we we're sort of doing our own thing. It's almost three, three waves here. The sort of the, the transaction is approved, we hope, and toward the middle of the year, and then we'll be able to sort of look at reinsurance and obviously contemplate it before, but look at reinsurance pretty quickly as part of that, the sort of supply chain and how we can support this business with the supply chain and arrangements that we have. And then there's sort of the, the integration and sort of actually bringing onto our platform which does take a bit longer. And that's sort of, we're sort of saying that as more sort of in the, of a couple of years that we think it'll take us by the time we, and that as part of that process, we'll need some sort of court approval probably where we'll migrate the policies from the current entity to, to IAL. And that's, that's, that's something that's, that's happened many times in this market before. It's all within the IAG world. so therefore, in relation to what you should see in the first year of financials, as, you know, with the sort of the 15% margin, 14 to 15% ROE and, and you know, an uplift, ass ing we settle on one July 25 an uplift in our premi pool of 1.3, 1.4 billion from this business, that's, that's what we should be expecting. thanks. Just a second question just coming back to I think one of Julie's slides talking about customer retention over 90% and you have, you know, one of your targets getting to a hundred percent. I mean, just wondering if you can elaborate on that. You know, is it actually a, a, a realistic target that you're actually aiming for? Is it kind of an aspirational target? How, how do you, you know, what are you investing in? How do the initiatives, how do you get there? Sure. So I think we, we've sort of called out a desire that customers that, that sort of slide says customers that have been with us for longer than 10 years. our aim and it is aspirational, is to retain a hundred percent of those customers. and we might not quite get there. but, but in terms of the message to our teams, these are our most valuable customer group. They're our most trusted customer group. We know the most about them. And I would like our teams to just be relentlessly focused on making sure that we are continuing to deliver to those customers that have given us their trust for that long. so it's a little bit aspirational, but we're focused on better service, better digital, bringing forward and helping customers understand our discounts our products by designing more services that, that meet their needs and really elevating the personal contact, which I think has been a little bit missing in our business. So that engagement with those, those customers longer than 10 years of tenure you know, connecting with them, making sure we understand their needs and really driving that retention up because that's where we create an incredible Amount of value for our business. Thank you. Hi, mark Tomlin, hunter Green. three questions if I may. First of all, I'd like to direct to William and your last slide on guidance reaffirm there seems to be a slight change in wording there, discussing that new business levels are challenging. Is that due to tough conditions in New Zealand or competition in Australia? Yeah, so, so I think we talked about what's happening with with inflation and obviously we're looking to rate to, to, to cover that at least. And, and so you know, we, we we're confident in our margin. I think our you know, we, we did note that the, in New Zealand in particular and, and you know, the, we know the economic conditions in New Zealand have become a bit more challenging. And so things are moderating there a bit. And, and I, yeah, there is some, there is some vol e challenge as well. I dunno whether Amand you wanted to Think. I think that's all right. Yeah. Okay. I'll move on to my second question then. in the past week we've also seen RAA South Australia be sold to Allianz. Did you look at RAA and if you did, you know, what were the relative merits you saw in RACQ compared to RAA? I mean, we won't, we won't comment on other stuff. now, I mean, I think I've, I've guided already that there, there's a n ber of insurers that got some similar challenges that are, that are looking at their futures. I'm not sort of come back to what we've done, which is sort of on strategy, very retail. and you know, we, you know, our view is we've been very financially disciplined in what we've done and sort of we've tried to lay out that profile for you so you can see that. and you know, we're pretty excited about that opportunity and sort of in our sweet spot and in our view, it's a natural partnership to be able to, to buy into, you know, the Queensland market where we're clearly underway. And about a month ago, many of us in the room were sitting at another insurer's strategy briefing where they also talked about under investment in commercial with, you know, both yourselves and the other insurers sharpening their pencils and commercial. Do you think you can both grow market share from others in the market? Or is it more around just becoming more efficient? for us it's really, we're focused on our own business and what we need to do. And we see there's pockets of opportunity for us to grow and we, we feel we're in a position to capitalize on those now. Our growth will be modest. we have a transformation plan as well until we really hit the efficiencies to make, to then really drive a growth engine. But we certainly have pockets within our business now that we look forward and we see growth. Great. Thanks very much Scott. one last question. Thanks very much for the opportunity, Philip Wesley from Paradise Investments. Just wondering, we've obviously learned a lot today about AI and how that's being used in the organization. Just wondering, Nick, maybe if you can give us a comment from a holistic sort of point of view, how do you think that the firm benchmarks to other peers here in Australia and also sort of best practice offshore, please? A around AI generally? Ar around AI specifically? Yes. Yeah, Yeah. I mean, we're seeing, we, we, we, we have seen sort of different things. We've seen sort of techno technology driven insurance companies that are startups and they've, they've generally had some problems because they've often haven't been able to match the insurance capability with the technology, and so they've ended up having capacity, but then coming a bit unstuck, really what we're doing, you know, we think it makes more sense to look at some of those other large players around the world and what, what are they doing and what, what, what, what can we learn from that? every, every, every successful retail insurer in the world is investing heavily in technology and particularly ai. what we're trying to, what we've learned is to do it at scale and to industrialize it and to sort of, our words sort of democratize that. And so not to not to be holding it in the center. What we've seen is those companies that are doing really well are just, are doing lots and lots and lots of small things and lots and lots and lots of use cases, lots and lots and lots of delivery at pace. And you, I think you've got that message from us today that, that, that seems to be the playbook for those companies that are, that are embracing and doing this well. because clearly there's gonna be a greater customer experience and over time there's gonna be some productivity efficiency gains. I think in commercial it's a little bit different. It's, you know, there's, there's the role of the, the intermediary is sort of, sort of sits there as well with a pretty important pretty, pretty important customer relationship. So generally we've seen it in pricing and in claims in, in, in, in, from my observation of other commercials. I mean, in a way we've had AI and IOG for some time, this is not a new topic. and you know, in a, so our business model has sort of depended upon that approach. what we're doing is trying to scale it, institutionalize it and democratize it, you know, to 14,000 people. Yeah, okay. But does, does that sort of conceivably mean though that, you know, if you need to be doing it at scale to win, then you know, that's something that others can do also, really. And the reality is that, you know, it will actually be something that other competitors and peers internationally are doing. No doubt. Yeah, I mean, no doubt. So then it's the package of IG that matters, isn't it? It's the brand, the customer relationship, the culture of our place, the capability. You know, it's not, I mean, I don't, I don't, I think it's, it's the package of things. It, it can't just be one thing because of course our competitors are investing in, in similar type of programs to us. So I don't think in itself that's gonna be the thing. It's the package of things that rev, that IAG is that I think is the source of competitive advantage. Yep. And maybe just Thank you build on Nick's pack package point just a tiny bit. The thing that we've got that's a real differentiator is data. and you need to be able to build great ai, you need great data. And the work that our technology teams have done over the last decade, we started this journey in 2014, has been about assembling particularly in the retail business, a really strong data asset. And that's powering our AI now. And I think, you know, lots of people can spend a lot of time on those things, but if you don't have access to data that you can utilize you, you really can't take advantage of the full capability. And that's what we are doing now. Yep. Okay. Thank you. That's a good point. can you also just comment on customer affordability. There's obviously a lot of focus on this for the government across a whole range of cons er type products, but you know, where do you see AI in this regard? So I'm sorry IAG in this regard. and you know, perhaps you can just sort of comment on whether you think it is impacting sort of pricing and you know, perhaps your potential pricing power looking forward. I mean, we've been super focused on this point and that we know there, there are many challenges out there in Australia and New Zealand and the cost of insurance is not helping those, those challenges. house, you know, to household budgets. I mean sort of the, and you know, we know why the inflation cost of services, cost of reinsurance, all the things that have happened, just frequency of events. sort of the, the, the, the, and few, few facts though retention levels have remained really strong and I don't think we've seen material exiting of the insurance market by households and businesses of Australia and New Zealand. And, and then sort of the, the slight positive is the tone from the team, which is sort of that inflationary price per, which was sort of double digit everywhere. across all insurers, all markets is definitely coming back. And so motor is, is the most material. New Zealand is also materially coming down in, in relation to rate of increase. So, you know, where it was, everything was double digit now it's not, you know, motor is sort of, is definitely coming back property. You heard Julie's comments before that we're cautious about that. but there are some signals that that inflationary pressure is coming down and commercial, there's sort of a slightly different story. So yes, affordability is a major concern there. There's lots we've done to help with that. the outlook from here is probably slightly better around that driven by cost of reinsurance as well. We sort of see the, the, the, the, there's more positive signals around that. and so for households, the out the sort of the outlook is probably slightly more favorable than what the last one to two years has been, which has been, you know, really challenging for challenging to run the insurance company. Very challenging for cons er and businesses around the, the cost of insurance. Thank you. I think we're good. I mean, just let me just, let me close before I invite those of us to in the room to come for lunch. I mean, we're, we, we, what you see today is definitely a stronger and a more resilient IAG. and there's just a boatload of things that have happened here over the last n ber of years that have got us to this position. So we're really proud about that. You can tell what within that, you know, two thirds of the company's our retail business. And you can see we've transformed that. We've, we've, we've delivered a trans tasman common platform for claims policy and pricing and admin. I mean, that's, that's not easy to achieve. And what that really sets ourselves up at the same time within our commercial businesses, we've really been super focused on underwriting discipline. There's some more technology and spend that still has to occur there. But, you know, we've moved that business a mile and we see that as sort of as, as opportunity for us. at the same time, we're gonna be, we're gonna be disciplined in, in how we spend our money. And so, you know, we've outlined that we still, productivity efficiency technology's part of that. We're gonna take at least a hundred basis points out of the expense ratio over the next couple of years. And we're gonna continue to be diligent in that. And then we're gonna package that up with this sort of, this story that, that this thing that I, I, I strongly believe in around a sort of a, a capital light, low volatility insurance company, which is what, you know, I-A-G-I-A-G is. and, you know, we're gonna continue down that path. So thank you everyone for your interest in, in IAG those online will say goodbye. And thank you for participating those in the room. we, we, we ask you to, to join us for, for a light lunch with, with all the management team here in our premises in Sydney. Hey, thanks again everybody.
