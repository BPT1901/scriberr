Hey, morning everyone, and uh, welcome to G'S uh,

00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:07.925
2024 Investor Day.

00:00:08.665 --> 00:00:11.245
Uh, it's great to see so many people here in our Sydney

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:20.165
Uh, we're holding this session today on the lands

7
00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:23.285
of the Gadigal people, and IG acknowledges traditional

8
00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:24.845
owners of country throughout Australia

9
00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:27.965
and recognize their continuing connections to land,

10
00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:29.885
waters and the communities.

11
00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:32.285
And of course, I pay my respects to elders past,

12
00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:33.685
present and emerging.

13
00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:37.245
In terms of this morning's agenda.

14
00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:40.685
We'll start with a presentation on our technology roadmap

15
00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:43.485
from Neil and then Julie, Jared

16
00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:46.845
and Amanda are gonna provide an update on their strategies

17
00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:48.725
and the progress that you'll see we are making

18
00:00:49.185 --> 00:00:50.285
in each of the divisions.

19
00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:54.445
We're obviously pleased to announce these strategic alliance

20
00:00:54.445 --> 00:00:57.365
last week with RACQ, and Neil

21
00:00:57.385 --> 00:00:58.885
and Julie are gonna talk about

22
00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:02.445
how our investment in our enterprise platform reduces

23
00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:03.765
that integration risks

24
00:01:03.985 --> 00:01:07.045
and really does demonstrate long-term benefits to

25
00:01:07.045 --> 00:01:08.125
what we've been investing in.

26
00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:12.085
We will pause this webcast, so everyone on the,

27
00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:14.165
on the webcast, we'll pause this a about 10 10

28
00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:18.005
and we're gonna have two breakout sessions focusing on our,

29
00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:21.125
on sort of customer and productivity initiatives that are,

30
00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:22.965
that are for the people in the room to attend.

31
00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:27.285
We'll resume back in here at about 1130, uh,

32
00:01:27.345 --> 00:01:29.685
and Williams's gonna provide an update around around finance

33
00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:31.965
and capital 1145.

34
00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:36.845
Then everyone will all be on stage, open to q and a, um,

35
00:01:36.865 --> 00:01:38.845
and the whole team will be, will step up here

36
00:01:39.345 --> 00:01:41.485
and though for those in the room, we'll invite you

37
00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:43.005
to join us for lunch, uh,

38
00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:45.565
which we imagine will start around about 1230.

39
00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:47.525
So please hang around and you've got the whole

40
00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:49.805
of the IG executive team here today,

41
00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:51.245
not just those, uh, presenting.

42
00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:55.325
So in terms of today,

43
00:01:55.955 --> 00:01:58.125
what we're gonna do is provide you an update on our sort

44
00:01:58.125 --> 00:01:59.925
of strategic outlook and what,

45
00:01:59.925 --> 00:02:02.885
and sort of our confidence, um, about the future

46
00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:05.605
as we're successfully delivering on our, around our purpose,

47
00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:08.245
about around making your world a safer place.

48
00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:12.205
And as we sort of look out to 2030

49
00:02:12.825 --> 00:02:15.365
and the opportunities in front of us, sort

50
00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:17.965
of it's important on a day like today to reflect on,

51
00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:20.085
on things that have occurred and how we've got here

52
00:02:21.145 --> 00:02:25.365
and what, and what we're really sure about is that IAG, um,

53
00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:27.605
is a stronger and a more resilient company

54
00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:29.245
today than we have been.

55
00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:33.765
So sort of in terms of, of sort of strategy, it's a,

56
00:02:33.765 --> 00:02:34.965
and that's relatively simple.

57
00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:39.125
We're focused entirely on general insurance products in

58
00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.445
Australia and New Zealand.

59
00:02:42.105 --> 00:02:44.525
As you know, structurally we've separated out

60
00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:46.725
and differentiated our retail

61
00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:49.605
and our intermediated businesses, ensuring

62
00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:51.805
that those two businesses are focused on their different

63
00:02:52.165 --> 00:02:54.405
customer and their different product segments.

64
00:02:55.865 --> 00:02:58.325
In Australia, our partnership that we announced last week

65
00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:00.405
around RACQ means

66
00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:02.725
that our insurance products are now being distributed

67
00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:05.845
through three of the strongest brands in financial

68
00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.125
services in our markets.

69
00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.885
We've simplified our brand offering in South Australia

70
00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:15.005
and Western Australia and we've firmly established NRMA

71
00:03:15.035 --> 00:03:17.805
insurance as a national brand outside

72
00:03:17.805 --> 00:03:20.485
of Victoria in New Zealand.

73
00:03:20.665 --> 00:03:23.965
Amanda will explain how we've differentiated our A MI

74
00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:25.365
and our state offerings

75
00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:28.165
and we've materially uplifted our risk

76
00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:29.645
capability across IIG.

77
00:03:30.025 --> 00:03:32.685
And as you know, we're using reinsurance in innovative ways

78
00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:34.765
to reduce our volatility.

79
00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:39.365
So strategically, IG is a simpler business today.

80
00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:43.365
As part of that simplification agenda,

81
00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:47.005
we've reduced the complexity of our retail product offerings

82
00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:49.205
and we've aligned our leadership structures.

83
00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:52.365
Our most recent pulse survey,

84
00:03:52.735 --> 00:03:55.885
which saw a strong engagement score of around 78

85
00:03:56.265 --> 00:03:58.245
for our 14,000 people who work

86
00:03:58.245 --> 00:03:59.805
for us across Australia and New Zealand.

87
00:04:00.465 --> 00:04:01.645
And of course that's important

88
00:04:02.365 --> 00:04:03.965
'cause it's our people are sort of key

89
00:04:03.965 --> 00:04:06.125
to driving the trust in our brands that exist.

90
00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:10.605
As you know, NRMA insurance is the most trusted brand in

91
00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:12.045
insurance in our markets.

92
00:04:14.265 --> 00:04:15.645
And of course these are flowing through

93
00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:16.925
to positive customer metrics

94
00:04:17.335 --> 00:04:20.565
where we see high NPS results in both Australia

95
00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:22.365
and New Zealand businesses.

96
00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:25.605
And we continue to have really strong retention

97
00:04:25.605 --> 00:04:26.805
rates and we'll show you those.

98
00:04:27.465 --> 00:04:31.405
So these strong customer metrics sort of help set us up well

99
00:04:32.025 --> 00:04:34.965
for what we see as opportunities for growth going forward.

100
00:04:37.815 --> 00:04:40.045
These strategic and operational successes

101
00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:42.405
and things we've done with an IAG over the last couple

102
00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:45.365
of years are flowing through to our financial performance.

103
00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:50.765
Our premiums have grown by around 35% since 2020.

104
00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:52.885
And sort of importantly,

105
00:04:53.105 --> 00:04:55.645
our low volatility capital light strategy

106
00:04:56.265 --> 00:05:00.205
has kept our prescribed capital amount relatively flat even

107
00:05:00.205 --> 00:05:02.085
though premiums have grown 35%.

108
00:05:03.105 --> 00:05:04.125
And of course we've achieved

109
00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:07.005
that in an evolving natural perils environment.

110
00:05:07.935 --> 00:05:12.445
Since 2020, we've doubled our natural perils allowance

111
00:05:12.905 --> 00:05:15.645
and our reinsurance costs are up 50%

112
00:05:15.675 --> 00:05:16.965
over the same time period.

113
00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:19.685
And despite these challenges,

114
00:05:19.905 --> 00:05:22.845
the profitability we're achieving now is consistent

115
00:05:22.845 --> 00:05:26.165
with our financial targets of a 15% insurance margin

116
00:05:26.665 --> 00:05:29.005
and a 14 to 15% ROE.

117
00:05:29.945 --> 00:05:33.285
And our view these targets balance the interests of all

118
00:05:33.285 --> 00:05:35.125
of our stakeholders of IAG

119
00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:39.045
In relation to the future.

120
00:05:39.745 --> 00:05:42.285
You know, by 2030 our view is

121
00:05:42.285 --> 00:05:43.965
that our population will have grown

122
00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:46.485
by over 2 million people across Australia and New Zealand.

123
00:05:47.265 --> 00:05:49.205
And of course what that means is we think there'll be

124
00:05:49.205 --> 00:05:51.685
2.4 million more cars on the road,

125
00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:54.685
about a million more houses being built

126
00:05:55.425 --> 00:05:59.565
and about 300,000 more businesses created in that time.

127
00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:03.245
And of course that what that growth does well that'll

128
00:06:03.525 --> 00:06:06.565
increase the demand for our products into those markets.

129
00:06:07.985 --> 00:06:10.525
And what these graphs do is show the opportunity available

130
00:06:10.665 --> 00:06:11.885
of, of for IAG

131
00:06:11.885 --> 00:06:14.965
to participate in essentially the economic growth

132
00:06:15.025 --> 00:06:16.885
of Australia and New Zealand, which we see

133
00:06:16.885 --> 00:06:18.125
as a lot of upside.

134
00:06:19.985 --> 00:06:21.485
And behind that of course the value

135
00:06:21.485 --> 00:06:23.565
of the assets we're insuring will continue

136
00:06:23.565 --> 00:06:26.405
to increase in our view faster than GDP

137
00:06:27.115 --> 00:06:28.605
cars are becoming more complex,

138
00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:31.405
greater technology particularly on anything on the outside

139
00:06:31.405 --> 00:06:32.405
of a vehicle as we know.

140
00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:36.685
And with climate change driving an increase in extreme

141
00:06:36.685 --> 00:06:39.565
weather events, our role as you know as

142
00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:41.485
that economic shock absorber in Australia

143
00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:43.165
and New Zealand will continue

144
00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:45.645
to be even more important than whatever it is today.

145
00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:50.085
So you sort of put that package together by 2030,

146
00:06:50.665 --> 00:06:51.765
we expect Australia

147
00:06:51.785 --> 00:06:53.605
and New Zealand general insurance markets

148
00:06:54.025 --> 00:06:58.685
to have a premium pool of around about 115 billion by 2030.

149
00:06:59.425 --> 00:07:02.005
And so from today, what we expect sort

150
00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.005
of compound annual growth of our markets

151
00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:07.365
of at least 6% across home motor

152
00:07:07.705 --> 00:07:10.925
and commercial exper commercial insurance over that period.

153
00:07:12.145 --> 00:07:13.965
And in our view, it's our customer experience

154
00:07:13.965 --> 00:07:15.885
and efficiency initiatives that we'll talk about

155
00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.645
that will ensure that we'll continue

156
00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:19.405
to grow our company in a sector

157
00:07:19.435 --> 00:07:21.925
that in itself is gonna be growing over that period.

158
00:07:24.105 --> 00:07:27.445
You said a step back, the strategy of IAG is unchanged

159
00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:30.685
and continues to be focused around these four pillars

160
00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:32.725
around sort of growing our business

161
00:07:33.425 --> 00:07:35.485
around strengthening the underlying business

162
00:07:35.485 --> 00:07:37.085
fundamentals, which we've done a lot on.

163
00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:40.045
Of course, we're gonna continue to invest in technology

164
00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:42.965
and at the same time we have,

165
00:07:42.965 --> 00:07:45.685
and we'll continue to focus on materially uplifting the

166
00:07:45.685 --> 00:07:48.165
groups from risk maturity, which is an important aspect of

167
00:07:48.325 --> 00:07:52.485
how we run our company in terms of our approach

168
00:07:52.505 --> 00:07:53.805
to m and a opportunities.

169
00:07:54.105 --> 00:07:56.565
And as we demonstrated last week, you know,

170
00:07:56.565 --> 00:07:59.245
that approach is highly aligned to the strategy

171
00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:01.485
that we're setting out, you know,

172
00:08:01.485 --> 00:08:04.125
and to be sort of stating the obvious, we are only focused

173
00:08:04.665 --> 00:08:07.645
on businesses and customers in Australia and New Zealand.

174
00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:09.205
That's the focus of our strategy.

175
00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:12.045
As you know, these are markets we understand

176
00:08:12.545 --> 00:08:14.525
and where we are best positioned in our view

177
00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:16.605
to live our purpose and deliver value

178
00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:18.365
to customers, communities.

179
00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:20.725
And of course importantly all of our shareholders,

180
00:08:21.785 --> 00:08:23.165
in addition to RACQ,

181
00:08:23.225 --> 00:08:25.845
we do expect there'll be further opportunities in these

182
00:08:25.845 --> 00:08:29.085
markets as capital technology

183
00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:32.725
and regulation become increasingly challenging

184
00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:35.525
for subscale market participants in both

185
00:08:35.525 --> 00:08:37.165
Australia and in New Zealand.

186
00:08:38.745 --> 00:08:41.045
As Neil will cover, we've delivered the bulk

187
00:08:41.045 --> 00:08:44.205
of our retail core platform modernization program

188
00:08:44.745 --> 00:08:46.245
and we're already seeing the benefits of

189
00:08:46.245 --> 00:08:48.565
that delivery in Julie's and Amanda's business.

190
00:08:48.745 --> 00:08:52.365
Now we demonstrated with the A NZ partnership that we,

191
00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:53.765
that we put in place last year,

192
00:08:53.875 --> 00:08:56.885
that we can efficiently bring new partners onto

193
00:08:56.915 --> 00:08:59.965
that platform and we continue to refine our approach

194
00:08:59.965 --> 00:09:01.685
with partners in Australia and New Zealand.

195
00:09:02.145 --> 00:09:04.925
And what that does, of course is provide us confidence

196
00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:07.805
as we're gonna be integrating RACQ onto

197
00:09:07.835 --> 00:09:09.845
that PLA platform over the next couple of years.

198
00:09:11.225 --> 00:09:12.805
You know, from a strategic perspective,

199
00:09:13.305 --> 00:09:15.125
any partnership needs to be consistent

200
00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:17.285
with our Australian New Zealand brand strategies

201
00:09:17.285 --> 00:09:18.725
and needs to be able to fit in with those.

202
00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:22.125
And then financially we'll target opportunities

203
00:09:22.385 --> 00:09:25.085
to be EPS accretive in the first year

204
00:09:25.745 --> 00:09:27.485
and make sure they, they will contribute

205
00:09:27.505 --> 00:09:30.085
to delivering a 15% insurance margin

206
00:09:30.265 --> 00:09:33.885
and a 14 to 15% ROE targets.

207
00:09:35.345 --> 00:09:37.485
So just sort of stepping back in relation to m

208
00:09:37.485 --> 00:09:40.285
and a, we'll be financially disciplined in evaluating any

209
00:09:40.285 --> 00:09:43.885
opportunities and our capital allocation framework will,

210
00:09:43.915 --> 00:09:46.205
will ensure that we deliver against the targets

211
00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:50.285
that we've set, the combination

212
00:09:50.365 --> 00:09:52.685
of our businesses, deliver synergies

213
00:09:52.865 --> 00:09:56.085
and value sort of between our retail

214
00:09:56.085 --> 00:09:57.245
and commercial businesses.

215
00:09:57.505 --> 00:10:00.005
We can serve customers insurance needs

216
00:10:00.155 --> 00:10:02.205
through their different channel of choice

217
00:10:02.905 --> 00:10:04.605
and are well positioned to satisfy more

218
00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:07.125
of the insurance needs of Australia and New Zealand.

219
00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.845
We've got some of the best consumer insurance brands in the

220
00:10:11.845 --> 00:10:14.205
world and so I've asked Julie

221
00:10:14.265 --> 00:10:18.245
and Amanda to benchmark themselves against leading global

222
00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:19.685
retail insurers.

223
00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:23.125
That's the peer group I think, of our businesses in terms

224
00:10:23.125 --> 00:10:24.325
of commercial businesses.

225
00:10:24.675 --> 00:10:26.925
This has been reset when you,

226
00:10:26.925 --> 00:10:29.565
and we've got a much more detailed focused underwriting

227
00:10:29.565 --> 00:10:31.285
discipline within the culture there.

228
00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:35.485
The result, of course is a material uplift in the financial

229
00:10:35.485 --> 00:10:37.365
performance of our commercial business.

230
00:10:38.345 --> 00:10:39.645
And the opportunity here is

231
00:10:39.645 --> 00:10:41.645
to ensure this business continues to improve

232
00:10:41.745 --> 00:10:45.485
and is comparable to global leaders in commercial insurance,

233
00:10:45.935 --> 00:10:47.685
which are different to those

234
00:10:47.715 --> 00:10:49.485
that we're benchmarking ourselves against

235
00:10:49.545 --> 00:10:50.845
on for retail insurance.

236
00:10:52.745 --> 00:10:56.525
Behind that, of course technology is a key enabler for all

237
00:10:56.525 --> 00:10:59.445
of our businesses and that's why I've asked Neil to come

238
00:10:59.445 --> 00:11:02.365
and talk about the technology platform that we've set up

239
00:11:02.585 --> 00:11:05.445
and really setting ourselves up importantly for the future.

240
00:11:06.145 --> 00:11:08.085
So I'll stop there and hand you over to Neil.

241
00:11:08.115 --> 00:11:09.685
He's gonna give us a bit more color on that.

242
00:11:16.105 --> 00:11:19.045
Thanks Nick and good morning all. My name's Neil Morgan.

243
00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.965
I'm the Chief operating officer at IAG.

244
00:11:21.385 --> 00:11:23.685
Uh, I have the privilege of leading the technology

245
00:11:23.685 --> 00:11:26.405
and operations teams and as Nick referred to

246
00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:28.765
and I described at this session last year,

247
00:11:29.095 --> 00:11:31.285
we've been delivering back-to-back transformations now

248
00:11:31.285 --> 00:11:32.325
since 2018.

249
00:11:32.985 --> 00:11:35.885
And our focus has been on creating the foundations

250
00:11:35.955 --> 00:11:37.725
that unlock our growth ambition,

251
00:11:38.145 --> 00:11:40.165
enable outstanding customer experiences

252
00:11:40.905 --> 00:11:42.765
and create the level of control

253
00:11:42.985 --> 00:11:45.005
and efficiency that we expect of ourselves.

254
00:11:46.195 --> 00:11:49.365
Over the last 40 years, we accumulated a significant amount

255
00:11:49.365 --> 00:11:50.725
of architectural complexity

256
00:11:51.265 --> 00:11:54.565
and whilst we definitely created value from those platforms,

257
00:11:54.745 --> 00:11:56.325
we committed to being the management team

258
00:11:56.595 --> 00:11:58.645
that would modernize that technology landscape.

259
00:11:59.305 --> 00:12:01.525
And as you're aware, our initial focus was on claims.

260
00:12:02.105 --> 00:12:03.925
So claims consolidation, moving

261
00:12:03.925 --> 00:12:06.605
to a single claims platform two years ago now,

262
00:12:07.245 --> 00:12:09.285
creating a foundation on which we could quickly

263
00:12:09.545 --> 00:12:13.245
and easily launch new features for the entire organization,

264
00:12:13.555 --> 00:12:14.885
including claims tracking

265
00:12:15.025 --> 00:12:16.805
and digital lodgement improvements.

266
00:12:17.455 --> 00:12:19.685
We've prioritized operational efficiency,

267
00:12:19.985 --> 00:12:22.365
better informing customers of their claims progress

268
00:12:22.705 --> 00:12:24.485
and getting customers back on the road

269
00:12:24.505 --> 00:12:28.525
and back into their homes faster with claims delivered.

270
00:12:28.825 --> 00:12:31.365
We move to retail distribution, pricing

271
00:12:31.465 --> 00:12:34.405
and policy management and over the last 12 months,

272
00:12:34.735 --> 00:12:37.165
we've had a huge delivery year for our retail businesses.

273
00:12:37.775 --> 00:12:39.925
We've now deployed the platform for all

274
00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:43.645
of our scale strategic brands and we're migrating at pace,

275
00:12:43.945 --> 00:12:45.885
and I'll go a little bit deeper on that in just a moment.

276
00:12:47.465 --> 00:12:49.205
The equivalent distribution pricing

277
00:12:49.265 --> 00:12:51.765
and policy system record of, uh, system

278
00:12:51.765 --> 00:12:53.605
of record work has now commenced

279
00:12:53.605 --> 00:12:55.085
for our intermediated businesses as well.

280
00:12:55.615 --> 00:12:57.365
We're excited about that opportunity.

281
00:12:58.225 --> 00:13:00.965
The opportunity also supports us delivering that

282
00:13:01.105 --> 00:13:02.485
for our cross Tasman businesses.

283
00:13:03.225 --> 00:13:06.645
We see significant growth opportunity around the ease

284
00:13:06.725 --> 00:13:10.045
of broker partnering and for the expense ratio improvement.

285
00:13:11.065 --> 00:13:13.445
And behind these customer facing transformations,

286
00:13:13.445 --> 00:13:16.045
we've been steadily consolidating our core operational

287
00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:18.685
capabilities, our risk platforms, our people

288
00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:20.085
and our digital workplace

289
00:13:20.085 --> 00:13:21.605
capabilities have been transformed.

290
00:13:21.605 --> 00:13:24.125
In parallel the decommissioning

291
00:13:24.125 --> 00:13:26.165
that these changes allow simplifies

292
00:13:26.165 --> 00:13:27.325
our technology landscape.

293
00:13:27.745 --> 00:13:29.725
It reduces risk and it improves control.

294
00:13:30.145 --> 00:13:34.365
And to date, we've decommissioned almost 300 assets, 289

295
00:13:34.365 --> 00:13:36.325
to be precise and there's more on the roadmap

296
00:13:36.325 --> 00:13:38.925
as we complete our transformation streams.

297
00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:42.485
So to go just a little bit deeper on our retail journey,

298
00:13:43.475 --> 00:13:45.085
this view demonstrates why we feel

299
00:13:45.085 --> 00:13:46.485
we're entering a new phase now.

300
00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:49.565
One where our focus is on innovating on top of

301
00:13:49.565 --> 00:13:51.365
that transformed core, both

302
00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:52.885
for our customers and for our business.

303
00:13:53.695 --> 00:13:55.845
We've delivered a single core tech stack

304
00:13:55.845 --> 00:13:58.845
for our retail business and the brand coverage of that stack

305
00:13:58.845 --> 00:14:02.605
and those new platforms is approximately $7 billion of GWP.

306
00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:06.485
We've proven that it scales, we have 3 million risks, uh,

307
00:14:06.555 --> 00:14:07.645
live on that platform

308
00:14:07.665 --> 00:14:10.725
and we are migrating around 350,000 a month.

309
00:14:11.945 --> 00:14:13.605
So of course that hasn't been easy,

310
00:14:13.825 --> 00:14:16.085
but we've built a lot of muscle over the course

311
00:14:16.085 --> 00:14:18.445
of more than 60 releases on that program

312
00:14:18.505 --> 00:14:20.205
and that muscle proved very,

313
00:14:20.205 --> 00:14:23.565
very valuable over the last 12 months as we've gone live

314
00:14:23.595 --> 00:14:26.765
with our scale brands, particularly NRMA state

315
00:14:26.905 --> 00:14:28.645
and the a MI direct portfolios.

316
00:14:30.385 --> 00:14:32.325
In addition to the customer facing deployments

317
00:14:32.325 --> 00:14:33.405
and the experience uplifts,

318
00:14:33.405 --> 00:14:35.765
we've also transitioned our customer mastering solution,

319
00:14:36.345 --> 00:14:37.525
our finance integration.

320
00:14:37.735 --> 00:14:40.605
We've API enabled the architecture to support scaling.

321
00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:44.365
So this transformation is pretty fundamental to our future.

322
00:14:45.145 --> 00:14:47.765
Um, just to give you a flavor of some of the outcomes

323
00:14:47.765 --> 00:14:51.005
that we've seen, we now have a single core platform with,

324
00:14:51.005 --> 00:14:52.485
with harmonized products and capabilities

325
00:14:52.585 --> 00:14:55.045
and that significantly simplifies our

326
00:14:55.045 --> 00:14:56.245
operations for our people.

327
00:14:56.875 --> 00:14:58.405
It's allowed us to build features

328
00:14:58.405 --> 00:15:00.125
and deploy them, so build them once

329
00:15:00.125 --> 00:15:01.765
and deploy them to all brands.

330
00:15:02.585 --> 00:15:03.725
Um, secondly,

331
00:15:03.725 --> 00:15:06.085
the strategic pricing capability we've delivered has been

332
00:15:06.085 --> 00:15:08.605
the single biggest win through the transformation.

333
00:15:09.355 --> 00:15:12.645
That pricing capability is significantly more sophisticated,

334
00:15:12.835 --> 00:15:15.165
both in terms of the speed of making change

335
00:15:15.585 --> 00:15:18.205
and in the granularity of the insight that it provides.

336
00:15:19.255 --> 00:15:21.405
We've seen a material improvement in risk selection

337
00:15:21.505 --> 00:15:23.885
and pricing accuracy each time we've onboarded a brand

338
00:15:23.885 --> 00:15:25.165
to the enterprise platform.

339
00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:29.015
Third, our online and mobile app experiences have lifted,

340
00:15:29.715 --> 00:15:31.415
uh, that fulfills commitments

341
00:15:31.415 --> 00:15:34.295
where some brands previously had quite limited capability,

342
00:15:34.955 --> 00:15:38.095
uh, and reuse of these assets has supported some excellent

343
00:15:38.095 --> 00:15:40.055
app store ratings that continue today.

344
00:15:41.115 --> 00:15:42.375
And then finally, uh, speaking

345
00:15:42.395 --> 00:15:45.295
as the operational technology owner perhaps best of all,

346
00:15:45.295 --> 00:15:48.455
from my perspective, our retail core is far more resilient,

347
00:15:48.715 --> 00:15:50.255
secure cloud enabled.

348
00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:53.655
Those applications provide a stable foundation for us

349
00:15:53.655 --> 00:15:55.575
to support scale and growth.

350
00:15:56.435 --> 00:15:58.575
And through those changes, we've also learned a lot about

351
00:15:58.935 --> 00:16:01.575
bringing on partners as Nick mentioned, uh, the ability

352
00:16:01.575 --> 00:16:03.975
to onboard partners to that strategic solution.

353
00:16:03.975 --> 00:16:06.855
And we've seen that come through in, uh, the value delivered

354
00:16:06.855 --> 00:16:08.095
through winning the A NZ business

355
00:16:08.395 --> 00:16:10.015
and more recently in our confidence

356
00:16:10.155 --> 00:16:12.255
to support the RACQ partnership.

357
00:16:13.635 --> 00:16:16.375
So in terms of what's ahead, onboarding additional partners

358
00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:19.015
and our CTP business becomes the focus of the program

359
00:16:19.115 --> 00:16:21.455
for the remainder of this year and into next year.

360
00:16:22.235 --> 00:16:24.335
And then as we move into our next phase

361
00:16:24.335 --> 00:16:26.975
of value from the platform, obviously that again,

362
00:16:26.975 --> 00:16:29.015
that focus on innovating on top of the core,

363
00:16:29.215 --> 00:16:31.895
continuously improving experiences and Jill

364
00:16:31.895 --> 00:16:34.535
and Amanda will talk more about their growth plans shortly.

365
00:16:35.265 --> 00:16:37.575
We're seeing some significant upsides

366
00:16:37.575 --> 00:16:38.695
you'll see on the slide there.

367
00:16:39.115 --> 00:16:41.495
Um, some of the improvements we've seen in digital channel

368
00:16:41.505 --> 00:16:43.255
share, increased conversions,

369
00:16:43.595 --> 00:16:45.415
the pricing improvements I described earlier.

370
00:16:46.035 --> 00:16:47.535
And through that, the retention

371
00:16:47.595 --> 00:16:50.135
of our business has remained, uh, strong,

372
00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:51.295
which is obviously critical.

373
00:16:52.785 --> 00:16:55.655
We're also in a different position around inorganic growth.

374
00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:57.655
Um, as Nick mentioned

375
00:16:57.655 --> 00:17:00.455
and I I stated earlier, our ability to onboard partners

376
00:17:00.615 --> 00:17:03.815
and reuse the migration patterns is really critical to us.

377
00:17:04.275 --> 00:17:06.615
Um, we're in a fundamentally different place in

378
00:17:06.615 --> 00:17:08.855
that respect from where we were prior to the transformation.

379
00:17:10.675 --> 00:17:12.375
So to switch over to intermediated,

380
00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:14.575
we're at a different point in our journey.

381
00:17:15.075 --> 00:17:17.055
Um, but it's a journey that we know very well.

382
00:17:17.555 --> 00:17:19.175
So we're now in the final stages

383
00:17:19.555 --> 00:17:22.335
of building our first products in our target solutions

384
00:17:22.515 --> 00:17:24.215
and the intent is very consistent

385
00:17:24.215 --> 00:17:26.135
with the retail experience I just described.

386
00:17:26.655 --> 00:17:30.615
A simplified modern cloud enabled platform that allows us

387
00:17:30.615 --> 00:17:32.655
to then optimize and innovate on top of.

388
00:17:32.875 --> 00:17:34.895
And we're already seeing some of the value of that come

389
00:17:34.895 --> 00:17:37.055
through tactically in in JIRAs business.

390
00:17:37.635 --> 00:17:40.695
Uh, the use of gen AI for activities like ingestion

391
00:17:40.695 --> 00:17:41.855
of broker information

392
00:17:42.555 --> 00:17:44.335
and that part of our business, you know,

393
00:17:44.335 --> 00:17:47.855
has driven value from heritage platforms over a very long

394
00:17:47.855 --> 00:17:50.525
period and we recognize that we owe it to our partners

395
00:17:50.525 --> 00:17:53.125
to provide the best possible, most efficient

396
00:17:53.125 --> 00:17:54.605
and seamless experiences for them.

397
00:17:55.995 --> 00:17:57.285
Importantly, I think we're,

398
00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:58.605
we're looking at that as an opportunity.

399
00:17:58.605 --> 00:17:59.925
Trans trans Tasman.

400
00:18:00.185 --> 00:18:03.605
So we see significant upside in the reuse across AU

401
00:18:03.605 --> 00:18:05.845
and New Zealand, both in our package

402
00:18:06.025 --> 00:18:07.565
and our underwritten businesses.

403
00:18:08.105 --> 00:18:10.885
And from an expense perspective, this is an opportunity,

404
00:18:11.045 --> 00:18:13.085
a critical opportunity to remove manual work,

405
00:18:13.195 --> 00:18:14.525
have improved controls and

406
00:18:14.525 --> 00:18:17.125
and less referrals in our business, so better for us

407
00:18:17.125 --> 00:18:18.245
and better for our customers.

408
00:18:19.295 --> 00:18:21.965
Jared will talk more about the experience being enabled in a

409
00:18:21.965 --> 00:18:24.565
moment, but I have no doubt that this investment will ensure

410
00:18:25.285 --> 00:18:28.085
IAG is a simpler, stronger, more resilient business

411
00:18:28.355 --> 00:18:31.005
with better optionality in our intermediated space.

412
00:18:31.255 --> 00:18:33.165
We'll have less complex architecture.

413
00:18:33.755 --> 00:18:36.645
It's an opportunity to decommission more platforms, uh,

414
00:18:36.665 --> 00:18:39.285
and an ability to create more value from our

415
00:18:39.445 --> 00:18:40.485
structured and unstructured data.

416
00:18:41.105 --> 00:18:45.565
Uh, being that partner of choice for brokers on each

417
00:18:45.565 --> 00:18:48.485
of the previous slides, um, you'll have noted the language

418
00:18:48.485 --> 00:18:51.605
of inclusive innovation and i's AI platform.

419
00:18:52.105 --> 00:18:54.445
Uh, as you're aware, we have a really long history

420
00:18:54.745 --> 00:18:56.365
of AI usage at IAG.

421
00:18:57.025 --> 00:19:00.325
Um, we acquired a, a specialist business some 10 years ago

422
00:19:00.325 --> 00:19:03.885
and we kind of co-founded the Gradient Institute in 2018

423
00:19:03.945 --> 00:19:07.605
to support research and guidance in the ethical use of ai.

424
00:19:08.225 --> 00:19:10.925
And over the last year we've been building tools under the

425
00:19:11.045 --> 00:19:12.285
umbrella of inclusive innovation.

426
00:19:12.745 --> 00:19:15.725
Um, we believe that this is an enterprise topic.

427
00:19:15.875 --> 00:19:17.365
It's it's not about coders

428
00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:20.165
and engineers, it's about ensuring the value

429
00:19:20.185 --> 00:19:21.845
of these tools is in the hands

430
00:19:21.865 --> 00:19:23.685
of everyone right across our business.

431
00:19:24.425 --> 00:19:25.805
And of course, the timing

432
00:19:25.945 --> 00:19:29.245
of generative AI becoming ubiquitous and

433
00:19:29.265 --> 00:19:32.245
and us completing our retail platform transformation is a

434
00:19:32.245 --> 00:19:33.525
huge opportunity for us.

435
00:19:34.105 --> 00:19:35.845
So our ability to adopt these tools

436
00:19:35.905 --> 00:19:39.045
and innovate on top of the core is, is very different to

437
00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:40.245
where we were three years ago.

438
00:19:41.105 --> 00:19:43.525
In terms of our approach, we see the use

439
00:19:43.525 --> 00:19:45.245
of gen AI in three categories.

440
00:19:45.905 --> 00:19:47.645
Uh, we're organizing our capability

441
00:19:47.665 --> 00:19:49.605
and our investment around these categories.

442
00:19:49.785 --> 00:19:51.125
Uh, the first is deploy

443
00:19:51.545 --> 00:19:54.565
and the focus here is to create every bit of value possible

444
00:19:54.835 --> 00:19:56.725
through the use of the capability

445
00:19:56.725 --> 00:19:58.645
that's embedded in enterprise applications.

446
00:19:59.185 --> 00:20:02.125
So the most familiar to most people is Microsoft copilot,

447
00:20:02.705 --> 00:20:05.325
but we are working with many of our partners to understand

448
00:20:05.325 --> 00:20:07.765
and influence the product roadmap, uh, for

449
00:20:07.765 --> 00:20:10.645
how those capabilities will be deployed in their platforms

450
00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:13.845
that we can then get into the hands of our full workforce.

451
00:20:15.385 --> 00:20:17.045
The second category is

452
00:20:17.045 --> 00:20:19.965
where we've established a bespoke gen AI bot

453
00:20:19.965 --> 00:20:21.205
builder called Genie.

454
00:20:21.745 --> 00:20:24.445
Uh, and it's the distinction here is that it allows us

455
00:20:24.445 --> 00:20:26.485
to support IAG specific use cases,

456
00:20:26.945 --> 00:20:30.885
so focused on IAG information built rapidly at low cost

457
00:20:31.255 --> 00:20:34.685
addressing specific business problems or opportunities.

458
00:20:35.465 --> 00:20:37.165
And this is where we're driving a,

459
00:20:37.205 --> 00:20:38.325
a highly inclusive approach,

460
00:20:38.725 --> 00:20:40.285
enabling employees right across the business

461
00:20:40.425 --> 00:20:43.405
to benefit from this category of capability.

462
00:20:44.385 --> 00:20:46.645
To do that, we've trained 150 activators

463
00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:48.885
to support our people in building these solutions.

464
00:20:48.885 --> 00:20:52.445
They're across all divisions and those activators can advise

465
00:20:52.465 --> 00:20:54.445
and select on the right backend models.

466
00:20:55.365 --> 00:20:58.125
Consider the responsible reuse principles, use low-code,

467
00:20:58.125 --> 00:21:00.285
no-code solutions to build these solutions out,

468
00:21:01.045 --> 00:21:02.605
removing friction performing task

469
00:21:02.605 --> 00:21:03.885
faster and more efficiently.

470
00:21:05.185 --> 00:21:07.525
And then finally we have the composed category

471
00:21:07.525 --> 00:21:09.925
where we invest in deep AI capabilities

472
00:21:09.985 --> 00:21:11.805
and then scale them across the company.

473
00:21:12.415 --> 00:21:15.005
These are built by our specialist team creating custom

474
00:21:15.035 --> 00:21:16.525
solutions and,

475
00:21:16.545 --> 00:21:19.005
and we've seen some good wins in all of these categories.

476
00:21:19.225 --> 00:21:21.405
Uh, just to give you a feel for scale,

477
00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:24.085
we have over a hundred use cases now in experimentation

478
00:21:24.165 --> 00:21:25.565
or trial and production

479
00:21:26.185 --> 00:21:28.565
and the examples sort of called out on the slide.

480
00:21:29.025 --> 00:21:30.645
Uh, I think bring these to life.

481
00:21:31.105 --> 00:21:34.165
So in the teams have have used embedded tools

482
00:21:34.185 --> 00:21:37.285
to reduce the review effort on claims correspondence, not

483
00:21:37.285 --> 00:21:38.485
by little bit by 60%,

484
00:21:39.105 --> 00:21:41.925
but um, we've built an IAG specific solution

485
00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:45.765
to change the tone of voice across a whole, a whole s swath

486
00:21:45.765 --> 00:21:47.405
of marketing material and

487
00:21:47.405 --> 00:21:48.965
that saved us hundreds of thousands of dollars.

488
00:21:49.905 --> 00:21:52.525
And then finally in the composition category, uh,

489
00:21:52.655 --> 00:21:55.645
we've also had a big win with delivering the tool we refer

490
00:21:55.645 --> 00:21:56.925
to as Cassie, uh,

491
00:21:56.925 --> 00:21:58.885
that you'll see in a breakout session shortly

492
00:21:58.885 --> 00:21:59.925
with Jared and the team.

493
00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:05.205
So to close, uh, a few key messages from me as I hand over

494
00:22:05.205 --> 00:22:07.525
to Julie from a retail perspective,

495
00:22:07.975 --> 00:22:09.045
we're in a new world now.

496
00:22:09.425 --> 00:22:11.965
Uh, our focus is on driving value, innovating

497
00:22:11.985 --> 00:22:13.605
and supporting our growth objectives.

498
00:22:13.905 --> 00:22:15.725
On top of the platforms that we've deployed

499
00:22:16.385 --> 00:22:19.685
on intermediated, we're seeing early signs of success

500
00:22:19.785 --> 00:22:21.325
and now applying the capability

501
00:22:21.345 --> 00:22:24.365
and experiences from retail to support Jared

502
00:22:24.385 --> 00:22:26.925
and Amanda in taking their businesses to the next level.

503
00:22:27.745 --> 00:22:30.085
And then on the inclusive innovation side, we see this

504
00:22:30.085 --> 00:22:32.365
as a vehicle for us to adopt new capability,

505
00:22:33.205 --> 00:22:35.605
democratizing the use of these tools safely

506
00:22:36.185 --> 00:22:37.205
and creating better,

507
00:22:37.515 --> 00:22:39.925
more efficient experiences across our business.

508
00:22:40.985 --> 00:22:42.245
So thank you for your time.

509
00:22:42.435 --> 00:22:43.725
I'll hand you over to Julie now

510
00:22:43.725 --> 00:22:45.965
for a deep dive into the retail business.

511
00:22:53.345 --> 00:22:56.165
So good morning everyone, it's a pleasure to present

512
00:22:56.165 --> 00:22:59.285
to you today the update on retail insurance in Australia.

513
00:23:00.305 --> 00:23:01.365
My name is Julie Batch

514
00:23:01.425 --> 00:23:03.965
and I'm the CEO of this part of the business.

515
00:23:04.465 --> 00:23:06.725
And today I wanna talk to you about three things,

516
00:23:07.545 --> 00:23:08.685
the strength of our brands,

517
00:23:09.225 --> 00:23:11.325
our scale advantage across Australia

518
00:23:11.785 --> 00:23:14.685
and our differentiator into the future, our intent

519
00:23:14.825 --> 00:23:16.845
to move faster than anyone else.

520
00:23:18.425 --> 00:23:20.405
So to start a quick overview

521
00:23:20.545 --> 00:23:22.365
of retail insurance in Australia,

522
00:23:22.535 --> 00:23:25.085
which now comprises two businesses.

523
00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:28.245
So firstly our direct to customer

524
00:23:29.005 --> 00:23:30.245
consumer business represented

525
00:23:30.305 --> 00:23:33.245
by our national flagship brand, NRMA insurance

526
00:23:33.905 --> 00:23:36.885
and our digital native innovator Roland

527
00:23:37.785 --> 00:23:39.645
and our portfolio of partnerships

528
00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:43.165
that includes our Victorian insurance partner, RACV,

529
00:23:43.665 --> 00:23:46.045
and our national distribution relationships.

530
00:23:47.395 --> 00:23:50.165
This year our businesses will collectively write gross

531
00:23:50.245 --> 00:23:52.765
premiums of more than 8.3 billion

532
00:23:53.385 --> 00:23:56.605
and help well over 5 million Australians.

533
00:23:57.505 --> 00:24:00.085
So to touch on our brands next year,

534
00:24:00.285 --> 00:24:02.365
NRMA insurance turns a hundred years old

535
00:24:02.945 --> 00:24:06.565
and that today it remains the most trusted insurance brand

536
00:24:06.665 --> 00:24:09.525
in Australia is something that we are incredibly proud of.

537
00:24:11.085 --> 00:24:13.125
Roland is our innovation engine

538
00:24:13.665 --> 00:24:16.525
and it's currently scaling the first insurance product

539
00:24:17.725 --> 00:24:20.845
telematics product that is linked to insurance in Australia

540
00:24:21.465 --> 00:24:23.325
and it's winning value awards.

541
00:24:24.665 --> 00:24:27.645
We recently celebrated the 25th anniversary

542
00:24:27.705 --> 00:24:30.725
of our enduring relationship with RACV, one

543
00:24:30.725 --> 00:24:32.605
of the top 20 strongest brands in the country.

544
00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:35.805
And our distribution partnerships include newer

545
00:24:35.805 --> 00:24:37.885
relationships like a NZ

546
00:24:38.385 --> 00:24:39.925
and those that have stood the test

547
00:24:40.205 --> 00:24:43.165
of time including Bendigo Bank and People's Choice.

548
00:24:44.505 --> 00:24:46.685
And next time we speak to you subject

549
00:24:46.785 --> 00:24:51.245
to regulatory approvals, we'll include RACQ on this slide,

550
00:24:51.765 --> 00:24:55.405
a 25 year partnership that will last likely well

551
00:24:55.405 --> 00:24:58.925
beyond my tenure and possibly your own reporting.

552
00:25:00.305 --> 00:25:03.125
So let me recap a little bit on our progress so far.

553
00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:07.485
We've been on a multi-year journey to modernize our business

554
00:25:08.065 --> 00:25:10.125
and via our incredible brands, we are ready

555
00:25:10.125 --> 00:25:13.165
to accelerate into our next phase of growth.

556
00:25:14.425 --> 00:25:16.325
We started by rationalizing

557
00:25:16.985 --> 00:25:21.405
our direct brand architecture and we launched NRMA

558
00:25:21.405 --> 00:25:24.525
and Roland as national brands In FY 22

559
00:25:25.745 --> 00:25:27.205
we simplified our products

560
00:25:27.665 --> 00:25:29.685
and we invested as Neil talked you

561
00:25:29.685 --> 00:25:31.725
through in our technology platform,

562
00:25:32.695 --> 00:25:34.325
we've grown our customer base

563
00:25:34.585 --> 00:25:36.805
to more than 5 million customers

564
00:25:37.265 --> 00:25:39.645
and we've maintained our financial returns.

565
00:25:41.465 --> 00:25:46.445
In FY 24 we focused on strengthening our business claims

566
00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:48.325
and supply chains were restructured

567
00:25:48.665 --> 00:25:51.565
and we established new distribution capability via the

568
00:25:51.565 --> 00:25:52.565
enterprise platform.

569
00:25:53.915 --> 00:25:57.205
Both major pieces of work have been successfully delivered

570
00:25:57.475 --> 00:25:59.245
with claim savings on motor

571
00:25:59.745 --> 00:26:02.605
of more than $750 per claim.

572
00:26:03.545 --> 00:26:07.405
And our direct business operating seamlessly on ep,

573
00:26:08.345 --> 00:26:11.485
the last policy actually moves across in four months time.

574
00:26:13.675 --> 00:26:17.005
This year we are seeing net customer growth increase again

575
00:26:17.425 --> 00:26:19.365
as these capabilities come to fruition

576
00:26:19.745 --> 00:26:21.285
and this is giving us a great deal

577
00:26:21.285 --> 00:26:22.885
of confidence about the future.

578
00:26:24.905 --> 00:26:27.285
So touching on the current operating environment,

579
00:26:27.785 --> 00:26:30.085
we really see it as one of opportunity.

580
00:26:30.825 --> 00:26:34.325
As Nick mentioned, the long-term growth prospects are

581
00:26:34.325 --> 00:26:38.005
strong, but we anticipate sustained segment growth across

582
00:26:38.025 --> 00:26:39.925
all segments that are relevant to retail

583
00:26:40.305 --> 00:26:43.725
and we're absolutely focused on capturing our share.

584
00:26:45.135 --> 00:26:46.965
Population growth is expected

585
00:26:46.985 --> 00:26:49.765
to be 1.4% over the coming years,

586
00:26:50.295 --> 00:26:52.885
which will elevate motor vehicle stock dwellings

587
00:26:52.945 --> 00:26:55.245
and small businesses by similar amounts

588
00:26:56.105 --> 00:26:58.365
and we expect inflation will continue to stabilize

589
00:26:58.985 --> 00:27:01.685
as normal operating conditions return

590
00:27:02.305 --> 00:27:05.405
across motor supply chains supported by the work

591
00:27:05.405 --> 00:27:08.965
that we've done rearchitecting our supply capacity

592
00:27:09.985 --> 00:27:13.645
and home is also moderating though at a slower pace.

593
00:27:15.465 --> 00:27:17.845
We know that this will help ease some of the pressure

594
00:27:18.195 --> 00:27:20.925
that Australians continue to feel with pricing.

595
00:27:22.865 --> 00:27:25.405
Our market is also highly competitive.

596
00:27:26.405 --> 00:27:29.285
Customers across the industry are switching at a very high

597
00:27:29.395 --> 00:27:33.965
frequency with 34% of them shopping their renewal around

598
00:27:35.265 --> 00:27:39.405
our customers have shown incredible loyalty with only 28%

599
00:27:39.405 --> 00:27:41.165
of them behaving in the same way.

600
00:27:41.785 --> 00:27:44.765
And this has helped us maintain our market leading retention

601
00:27:44.775 --> 00:27:47.445
rates during a really challenging time.

602
00:27:48.185 --> 00:27:49.325
We are always striving

603
00:27:49.345 --> 00:27:51.605
to help our customers when they need us the most.

604
00:27:53.665 --> 00:27:58.125
So to our vision, our vision is to be a help company.

605
00:27:58.865 --> 00:28:01.285
And this year we launched our national campaign

606
00:28:01.965 --> 00:28:04.365
positioning ourselves as a company that helps.

607
00:28:04.855 --> 00:28:08.005
First help means being there

608
00:28:08.025 --> 00:28:11.365
for Australians at every moment to support them

609
00:28:11.865 --> 00:28:14.165
to understand and protect their risk.

610
00:28:15.615 --> 00:28:18.085
We'll provide our customers with insights

611
00:28:18.275 --> 00:28:19.765
that make their worlds safer.

612
00:28:20.575 --> 00:28:21.725
We'll advocate for

613
00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:24.685
and invest in resilience, provide information

614
00:28:24.685 --> 00:28:26.245
that improves risk understanding,

615
00:28:26.385 --> 00:28:28.925
and show customers how best to protect themselves.

616
00:28:29.785 --> 00:28:32.725
In the breakout, Michelle Klein, our chief customer

617
00:28:32.725 --> 00:28:35.805
and marketing officer, will run you through a help company

618
00:28:36.225 --> 00:28:37.485
and the customer experience

619
00:28:37.485 --> 00:28:39.205
that underpins it in more detail.

620
00:28:41.185 --> 00:28:43.725
Our vision to be a help company is supported

621
00:28:43.725 --> 00:28:45.445
by three simple dynamics.

622
00:28:46.105 --> 00:28:48.365
So firstly, exceptional brands

623
00:28:48.365 --> 00:28:50.445
and partnerships through which we'll be able

624
00:28:50.445 --> 00:28:53.165
to access a broader set of customers

625
00:28:53.345 --> 00:28:55.605
and risks to support our growth.

626
00:28:57.375 --> 00:28:58.925
Australian made scale

627
00:28:59.515 --> 00:29:02.805
that delivers excellence in product pricing claims

628
00:29:02.945 --> 00:29:05.565
and technology from within the country

629
00:29:06.105 --> 00:29:07.965
and all the way across the country.

630
00:29:09.025 --> 00:29:12.885
And a singular focus to move faster than anyone else.

631
00:29:13.745 --> 00:29:16.845
And this means moving propositions to market rapidly

632
00:29:17.585 --> 00:29:20.205
and continuously improving our productivity

633
00:29:20.475 --> 00:29:23.005
through strong operating discipline across

634
00:29:23.025 --> 00:29:24.045
our retail business.

635
00:29:24.785 --> 00:29:27.365
Always keeping us ahead of the competition.

636
00:29:28.635 --> 00:29:29.925
I'll now step through each

637
00:29:29.925 --> 00:29:32.165
of these pillars in a little bit more detail.

638
00:29:34.905 --> 00:29:38.285
So firstly, great progress has been made evolving the

639
00:29:38.445 --> 00:29:40.365
customer experience delivered by our brand.

640
00:29:41.585 --> 00:29:44.365
Our absolute focus has been on successful delivery

641
00:29:44.365 --> 00:29:45.765
of the enterprise platform

642
00:29:46.145 --> 00:29:49.165
and with that behind us, now all our attention turns

643
00:29:49.305 --> 00:29:50.885
to elevating experience.

644
00:29:51.025 --> 00:29:53.245
On top of that through delivering fast

645
00:29:53.345 --> 00:29:55.925
and intuitive help that's personalized to needs

646
00:29:56.225 --> 00:29:59.005
and delivered through a customer's channel of choice.

647
00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:02.765
Our people, our frontline colleagues

648
00:30:03.345 --> 00:30:07.605
are already delivering high quality work through our retail

649
00:30:08.235 --> 00:30:09.965
call centers and branches.

650
00:30:10.955 --> 00:30:13.405
Improving digital to meet that level

651
00:30:13.425 --> 00:30:16.525
of customer service is our immediate priority.

652
00:30:18.095 --> 00:30:21.125
We've already simplified our quote to buy experience

653
00:30:21.125 --> 00:30:22.605
through enterprise platform

654
00:30:23.025 --> 00:30:26.645
and that's delivering a 10% increase in quote completions,

655
00:30:27.475 --> 00:30:29.205
elevating new business volumes,

656
00:30:29.405 --> 00:30:32.045
particularly in our heartland of New South Wales.

657
00:30:33.385 --> 00:30:37.285
And you can all see the refreshed experience on our website

658
00:30:37.425 --> 00:30:38.565
and in our apps.

659
00:30:39.545 --> 00:30:42.125
The NRMA insurance app has been downloaded

660
00:30:42.145 --> 00:30:44.205
by nearly 600,000 customers

661
00:30:44.625 --> 00:30:47.725
and that's increasing by 15,000 customers per month.

662
00:30:48.715 --> 00:30:50.005
Importantly, half

663
00:30:50.005 --> 00:30:52.805
of those customers are engaging within the app

664
00:30:52.835 --> 00:30:54.965
with our help hub rewards program

665
00:30:55.705 --> 00:31:00.245
and that means that 300,000 customers are actively engaged

666
00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:03.965
in risk reducing tasks that make their world safer

667
00:31:04.305 --> 00:31:06.325
and our insurance proposition stronger.

668
00:31:07.795 --> 00:31:10.085
That said, there are areas we can improve

669
00:31:10.665 --> 00:31:12.405
and as part of transforming tomorrow,

670
00:31:12.985 --> 00:31:14.885
we are building service that is quick

671
00:31:15.065 --> 00:31:17.765
and efficient so customers can get a

672
00:31:17.765 --> 00:31:18.845
quote in under two minutes.

673
00:31:19.855 --> 00:31:22.845
We're using AI to support our frontline colleagues

674
00:31:23.505 --> 00:31:25.285
and we are delivering more tailored

675
00:31:25.845 --> 00:31:28.525
personalized service to our customers.

676
00:31:28.985 --> 00:31:31.925
In particular those that have been with us for decades.

677
00:31:34.665 --> 00:31:37.005
In terms of our portfolio of partnerships,

678
00:31:37.985 --> 00:31:41.045
our perpetual relationship with RACV

679
00:31:41.715 --> 00:31:44.045
just celebrated its 25th year.

680
00:31:44.585 --> 00:31:47.765
It continues to go from strength to strength to today.

681
00:31:48.205 --> 00:31:52.525
RACV delivers insurance products to more than 1.3 million.

682
00:31:52.815 --> 00:31:57.365
Victorians distribution partners are new,

683
00:31:57.365 --> 00:31:58.605
however to RIA

684
00:31:59.105 --> 00:32:01.645
and we are evolving this segment to align it

685
00:32:01.645 --> 00:32:03.165
to our broader retail strategy

686
00:32:03.425 --> 00:32:05.605
and that's why we've brought these portfolios together.

687
00:32:06.865 --> 00:32:09.525
As part of phase one, we review

688
00:32:09.625 --> 00:32:13.125
and adjust our partnering model to drive greater efficiency.

689
00:32:14.145 --> 00:32:17.685
The lost ratios in our distribution relationships are really

690
00:32:18.045 --> 00:32:21.045
actually quite strong, but the opportunity here is

691
00:32:21.045 --> 00:32:24.765
to streamline the cost to serve by leveraging the efficiency

692
00:32:25.065 --> 00:32:26.765
of our direct business

693
00:32:28.265 --> 00:32:30.205
and we'll position the business for growth

694
00:32:30.755 --> 00:32:34.565
with new partners, selected new partners that broadly align

695
00:32:34.565 --> 00:32:35.725
with four key principles.

696
00:32:36.535 --> 00:32:39.525
Those are strong alignment to customer culture,

697
00:32:41.145 --> 00:32:43.965
access to markets that are beyond the reach

698
00:32:44.105 --> 00:32:48.525
of our direct brands, strong performance orientation

699
00:32:49.065 --> 00:32:50.605
and positive economics

700
00:32:51.145 --> 00:32:53.645
and the ability to deliver our superior product

701
00:32:53.645 --> 00:32:55.445
and pricing, allowing us

702
00:32:55.445 --> 00:32:57.365
to leverage our strong capabilities.

703
00:32:58.625 --> 00:33:01.565
So phase two is a selected pursuit

704
00:33:01.565 --> 00:33:03.765
of new partnership opportunities with brands

705
00:33:03.765 --> 00:33:07.325
that share our customer ethos, including motoring clubs

706
00:33:07.945 --> 00:33:11.165
and that give us broader expansive access to motor

707
00:33:11.305 --> 00:33:12.365
and home risks.

708
00:33:13.345 --> 00:33:15.085
The recent announcement of our alliance

709
00:33:15.085 --> 00:33:19.325
with RACQ is a great example of this on the basis

710
00:33:19.395 --> 00:33:20.845
that we progress successfully

711
00:33:20.845 --> 00:33:23.805
through the required approvals, the partnership

712
00:33:23.805 --> 00:33:26.005
with RACQ will provide us access

713
00:33:26.025 --> 00:33:28.965
to 1.7 million members in Queensland,

714
00:33:29.385 --> 00:33:32.965
adding approximately 1.3 billion of

715
00:33:33.495 --> 00:33:34.685
short tail motor

716
00:33:35.585 --> 00:33:38.485
and home premium to retail insurance,

717
00:33:39.305 --> 00:33:43.605
making our business a $10 billion premium business when this

718
00:33:43.605 --> 00:33:44.925
transaction completes.

719
00:33:47.545 --> 00:33:50.405
In terms of scale, there are three elements

720
00:33:50.405 --> 00:33:51.725
that we think are critically important

721
00:33:52.505 --> 00:33:55.885
and those are pricing excellence, product evolution,

722
00:33:56.425 --> 00:33:57.765
and a leading claims model.

723
00:33:58.735 --> 00:34:01.085
We've already made great progress with pricing

724
00:34:01.825 --> 00:34:05.525
in December, 2023, we reset our pricing strategy

725
00:34:05.625 --> 00:34:07.045
and it's delivering benefits.

726
00:34:07.105 --> 00:34:11.005
Now we expanded our modeling capability, the quality

727
00:34:11.025 --> 00:34:14.045
of which is already evident in our leading loss ratios.

728
00:34:15.025 --> 00:34:17.325
We deployed our earnings pricing engine,

729
00:34:17.615 --> 00:34:21.205
which is improving our ability to re estimate risk

730
00:34:21.345 --> 00:34:24.325
and leading to better business mix, improved pro profit

731
00:34:24.585 --> 00:34:27.325
and growth and we can analyze

732
00:34:27.425 --> 00:34:29.525
and adjust our prices in real time.

733
00:34:30.845 --> 00:34:33.205
Previously a process that took us at times weeks,

734
00:34:34.275 --> 00:34:37.005
this agility enables us to quickly respond

735
00:34:37.065 --> 00:34:39.445
to market signals, seize opportunities,

736
00:34:40.305 --> 00:34:42.445
and stay ahead of the competition.

737
00:34:43.635 --> 00:34:45.605
With products we've continued to simplify

738
00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:48.725
and make it easier for customers to understand what we offer

739
00:34:49.385 --> 00:34:51.365
and choose the right level of cover for them.

740
00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:55.245
And lastly, our next evolution of claims program,

741
00:34:55.295 --> 00:34:58.365
which we've previously shared with you is delivering

742
00:34:59.635 --> 00:35:03.485
some notable milestones include the increased visibility

743
00:35:03.505 --> 00:35:05.605
of claims progress through our tracker

744
00:35:05.865 --> 00:35:07.885
as we digitize our supply chain

745
00:35:08.275 --> 00:35:11.445
with more than 1 million visits to our tracker per year.

746
00:35:12.665 --> 00:35:15.645
Of course this takes calls outta the call center,

747
00:35:15.645 --> 00:35:17.885
giving our people greater opportunity

748
00:35:17.905 --> 00:35:21.045
to deliver good service rollout

749
00:35:21.045 --> 00:35:24.045
of property assessment services to drive earlier claims

750
00:35:24.565 --> 00:35:26.525
identification and risk identification,

751
00:35:27.065 --> 00:35:29.485
and to highlight prevention measures for customers,

752
00:35:30.215 --> 00:35:33.565
we've already delivered 10,000 property inspections

753
00:35:34.155 --> 00:35:38.085
including 3,700 of them done virtually.

754
00:35:38.435 --> 00:35:40.525
This is a great experience for customers.

755
00:35:41.855 --> 00:35:44.925
We've moved to AI enabled direct allocation model

756
00:35:44.925 --> 00:35:48.405
for motor claims and this is what's driving the 750 per

757
00:35:48.405 --> 00:35:49.605
vehicle reduction in cost

758
00:35:50.345 --> 00:35:54.885
and we've to date delivered 144 million of recurring savings

759
00:35:55.265 --> 00:35:58.445
of our $400 million program on track to elevate that

760
00:35:58.445 --> 00:35:59.805
to 200 million this year.

761
00:36:00.305 --> 00:36:03.165
And we're confident of reaching the $400 million claims

762
00:36:03.165 --> 00:36:04.485
target that we shared with you.

763
00:36:06.745 --> 00:36:08.885
And the final pillar of our strategy is one

764
00:36:08.885 --> 00:36:10.445
that we think will differentiate us

765
00:36:10.825 --> 00:36:13.845
and that's by moving faster than anyone else.

766
00:36:15.965 --> 00:36:18.285
A few years ago when I was in China just

767
00:36:18.285 --> 00:36:20.325
before covid, I asked many

768
00:36:20.325 --> 00:36:24.045
of the amazing scaled organizations that I met with

769
00:36:24.395 --> 00:36:26.445
what their key metric or driver was

770
00:36:26.945 --> 00:36:29.765
and I was surprised when every single one of them said time,

771
00:36:31.405 --> 00:36:33.565
actually they said 10 minutes.

772
00:36:34.385 --> 00:36:37.605
Um, but their focus was on the relentless reduction on time

773
00:36:37.625 --> 00:36:39.885
to serve and fulfill a customer's needs.

774
00:36:40.585 --> 00:36:43.205
The following year when I get back, it had got back,

775
00:36:43.305 --> 00:36:45.285
it had halved to five minutes.

776
00:36:46.065 --> 00:36:47.445
So that is what is inspiring us.

777
00:36:47.825 --> 00:36:52.325
The need to move at speed, leveraging our scale

778
00:36:53.855 --> 00:36:57.085
successful delivery of the enterprise platform gives us the

779
00:36:57.085 --> 00:37:00.805
ability to dramatically IMO improve our digital capabilities

780
00:37:01.465 --> 00:37:04.285
and we are focused on a greater share of digital engagement,

781
00:37:04.425 --> 00:37:07.205
faster decisioning and quicker adaptability.

782
00:37:08.335 --> 00:37:11.485
Today, 50% of our transactions and are through digital

783
00:37:11.985 --> 00:37:13.725
and of course if we look at that just

784
00:37:13.725 --> 00:37:16.845
through an efficiency lens, the more we drive to digital,

785
00:37:17.105 --> 00:37:18.645
the more efficient we will be.

786
00:37:18.955 --> 00:37:21.085
However, we also need to ensure

787
00:37:21.115 --> 00:37:23.325
that our customers can be served through the channel

788
00:37:23.325 --> 00:37:25.045
of choice that meets their needs

789
00:37:25.425 --> 00:37:29.085
and often in our business that is human to human.

790
00:37:29.385 --> 00:37:31.125
And so we are also focused on that.

791
00:37:32.745 --> 00:37:35.525
Our claims transformation is speeding up decision making.

792
00:37:36.215 --> 00:37:39.045
We've already seen positive results in supply chain.

793
00:37:39.385 --> 00:37:42.925
Our AI allocation tools are driving 80% accuracy

794
00:37:42.925 --> 00:37:44.005
of repair allocations

795
00:37:44.465 --> 00:37:47.725
and through further iterations this is lifting to 90%

796
00:37:48.665 --> 00:37:50.565
and our investment in new technology

797
00:37:50.665 --> 00:37:54.125
to drive claims efficiency right there across our um,

798
00:37:54.125 --> 00:37:56.925
claims supply chain has delivered a 40%

799
00:37:57.285 --> 00:37:58.525
reduction in cycle times.

800
00:37:59.625 --> 00:38:01.125
The productivity benefits

801
00:38:01.465 --> 00:38:04.165
for us moving more quickly are vast.

802
00:38:05.945 --> 00:38:10.205
So in summary, our vision is to be a help company,

803
00:38:11.225 --> 00:38:15.045
one that serves our customers through our exceptional brands

804
00:38:15.065 --> 00:38:19.205
and experiences delivers Australian made scale

805
00:38:19.985 --> 00:38:22.565
and moves faster than anyone else.

806
00:38:23.225 --> 00:38:24.645
And it's these three things

807
00:38:24.835 --> 00:38:27.485
that we believe will keep us ahead of the competition.

808
00:38:28.555 --> 00:38:31.405
It's now my pleasure to introduce Jared to share

809
00:38:31.405 --> 00:38:33.925
with you the progress in our intermediated portfolio.

810
00:38:39.385 --> 00:38:42.645
Thanks Julie. Um, good morning everyone. I'm Jared Hill.

811
00:38:42.745 --> 00:38:44.765
I'm the CEO of CGU and WFI.

812
00:38:45.495 --> 00:38:48.685
Today I'll provide an update on the pathway forward

813
00:38:48.825 --> 00:38:50.605
for Intermediated Insurance Australia.

814
00:38:51.465 --> 00:38:54.005
Now that we have entered the next horizon of our strategy,

815
00:38:55.155 --> 00:38:56.845
this follows successful delivery

816
00:38:57.065 --> 00:38:59.565
of our 250 million insurance profit target

817
00:39:00.435 --> 00:39:01.725
through Horizon one.

818
00:39:02.025 --> 00:39:05.445
We built positive momentum as we simplified our business,

819
00:39:06.315 --> 00:39:07.605
delivered profitable growth

820
00:39:08.025 --> 00:39:10.045
and improved the reputation of our brands.

821
00:39:11.505 --> 00:39:14.165
We have developed stronger core insurance capabilities

822
00:39:14.665 --> 00:39:15.805
to improve underwriting

823
00:39:15.865 --> 00:39:17.085
and pricing practices,

824
00:39:18.195 --> 00:39:20.765
establish more effective portfolio management,

825
00:39:21.305 --> 00:39:22.485
and laid the foundations

826
00:39:22.585 --> 00:39:25.125
to become a consistently high performing

827
00:39:25.155 --> 00:39:26.605
intermediated insurer.

828
00:39:27.785 --> 00:39:32.365
We have a broad portfolio of across personal lines, SME

829
00:39:32.365 --> 00:39:35.485
and agri commercial mid-market and corporate customers.

830
00:39:36.595 --> 00:39:38.605
Corporate is the smallest of these segments

831
00:39:39.305 --> 00:39:42.565
but has been a source of growth for CGU since FY 23.

832
00:39:43.995 --> 00:39:46.725
Through selective focus in targeted segments,

833
00:39:48.025 --> 00:39:52.045
we de we deliver products to customer across these segments

834
00:39:52.045 --> 00:39:55.765
through a range of intermediaries which provides optionality

835
00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:57.485
to shape our portfolio.

836
00:39:57.905 --> 00:40:01.765
Whilst, whilst maintaining scale, we've grown

837
00:40:01.765 --> 00:40:05.165
to generate 4.3 billion in gross written premium in FY 24

838
00:40:06.055 --> 00:40:08.885
while delivering a step change in profitability.

839
00:40:10.725 --> 00:40:13.145
We have rebuilt the CGU brand with brokers

840
00:40:13.765 --> 00:40:15.945
and are increasingly being recognized

841
00:40:15.945 --> 00:40:19.345
as a preferred partner in WFI.

842
00:40:19.685 --> 00:40:21.985
We have turned around performance to the extent

843
00:40:22.295 --> 00:40:24.665
that we now have the confidence in this portfolio

844
00:40:25.205 --> 00:40:29.025
to develop WFI as a growth engine for I I A.

845
00:40:30.205 --> 00:40:33.465
To achieve this, I've recently strengthened the leadership

846
00:40:33.465 --> 00:40:35.185
capability within WFI,

847
00:40:35.595 --> 00:40:37.585
which I'll touch on in more detail shortly.

848
00:40:38.875 --> 00:40:41.975
The agency partners that we support, including NTI

849
00:40:41.975 --> 00:40:44.055
and SUU, provides scale

850
00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:46.255
and margin benefits for our business,

851
00:40:47.145 --> 00:40:49.735
while also helping us extend our penetration

852
00:40:49.735 --> 00:40:51.575
and scale in several risk classes.

853
00:40:53.545 --> 00:40:56.535
While I I a may not have fully realized its earnings

854
00:40:56.765 --> 00:40:57.815
potential in the past,

855
00:40:58.755 --> 00:41:00.495
we have now demonstrated the opportunity

856
00:41:00.515 --> 00:41:03.775
for profitable growth that exists within our business.

857
00:41:04.595 --> 00:41:07.735
We will remain highly selective as we manage the portfolio

858
00:41:08.605 --> 00:41:10.495
with ongoing margin improvement.

859
00:41:10.635 --> 00:41:14.645
Our priority on joining IA in 2021,

860
00:41:15.225 --> 00:41:17.605
we launched our three horizon strategy

861
00:41:18.075 --> 00:41:20.725
with the immediate aim to deliver more than 250 million

862
00:41:20.725 --> 00:41:22.765
insurance profit by FY 24.

863
00:41:24.145 --> 00:41:27.325
We exceeded this goal which reflects the underwriting

864
00:41:27.325 --> 00:41:29.245
pricing and cost disciplines

865
00:41:29.635 --> 00:41:31.445
that have been established within our business.

866
00:41:32.585 --> 00:41:36.165
We will not move away from these disciplines as we seek

867
00:41:36.225 --> 00:41:37.685
to further grow the portfolio

868
00:41:38.185 --> 00:41:42.985
and build market share As we have done since FY 21.

869
00:41:43.415 --> 00:41:46.065
I'll continue focus the business on margin growth

870
00:41:46.455 --> 00:41:48.705
through responsible portfolio management.

871
00:41:51.125 --> 00:41:53.305
I'd like to talk to some specific examples

872
00:41:53.485 --> 00:41:56.105
of the recent actions we have taken to improve outcomes

873
00:41:56.605 --> 00:41:59.545
for our shareholders, customers and partners.

874
00:42:01.035 --> 00:42:03.185
These examples are evidence of our ability

875
00:42:03.185 --> 00:42:06.105
to incrementally deliver change at the same time

876
00:42:06.325 --> 00:42:10.185
as we undertake broader business transformation within I I A

877
00:42:11.555 --> 00:42:14.135
we refer to this as perform and transform.

878
00:42:15.065 --> 00:42:17.055
We'll meet the goals we have set ourselves

879
00:42:17.435 --> 00:42:18.535
and the expectations

880
00:42:18.535 --> 00:42:21.135
of shareholders while finding the capacity

881
00:42:21.475 --> 00:42:24.575
and resources to successfully transform I A A

882
00:42:25.085 --> 00:42:27.615
into a market leading intermediated insurer

883
00:42:28.965 --> 00:42:30.865
in our workers' compensation business.

884
00:42:31.405 --> 00:42:32.905
We have turned around performance

885
00:42:33.205 --> 00:42:37.105
by creating a dedicated end-to-end team under new leadership

886
00:42:37.935 --> 00:42:41.585
through a focus on cost management, targeted risk selection

887
00:42:41.885 --> 00:42:43.225
and specialist underwriting,

888
00:42:43.765 --> 00:42:46.145
we established an attractive portfolio of business.

889
00:42:48.015 --> 00:42:51.135
A focus on underwriting practices has enabled CGU

890
00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:54.135
to grow in the mid-market and large commercial segment.

891
00:42:55.275 --> 00:42:57.695
An example is our property ISR portfolio

892
00:42:59.225 --> 00:43:02.615
where we're attracting profitable new business growth in

893
00:43:02.615 --> 00:43:04.295
this portfolio has been enabled

894
00:43:04.635 --> 00:43:06.855
by developing our underwriting talent pool,

895
00:43:07.605 --> 00:43:10.015
including acquiring external leadership

896
00:43:10.675 --> 00:43:12.775
and delivering a better service experience

897
00:43:13.035 --> 00:43:14.335
for customers and brokers.

898
00:43:15.715 --> 00:43:18.175
Our claims team remained focused on efficiency,

899
00:43:18.635 --> 00:43:21.735
responsiveness and service through process redesign

900
00:43:21.915 --> 00:43:23.255
and the use of technology.

901
00:43:24.875 --> 00:43:27.095
We are seeing evidence of this through measures

902
00:43:27.165 --> 00:43:29.095
that monitor customer satisfaction

903
00:43:29.435 --> 00:43:30.735
and internal productivity.

904
00:43:32.145 --> 00:43:35.455
Those with us in the room today will see a showcase of one

905
00:43:35.455 --> 00:43:37.335
of these technology uh, use cases.

906
00:43:37.335 --> 00:43:40.615
Shortly in WFI,

907
00:43:40.955 --> 00:43:43.295
we have delivered pricing sophistication improve

908
00:43:43.295 --> 00:43:45.175
improvements within our agri book.

909
00:43:46.365 --> 00:43:49.975
This included transitioning our pricing functionality from

910
00:43:49.975 --> 00:43:53.735
the legacy WI 90 system to new technology models

911
00:43:53.795 --> 00:43:57.575
and algorithms in our I I A rating engine RAE.

912
00:43:58.475 --> 00:44:02.695
The 21 percentage point margin improvement in WFI since FY

913
00:44:02.695 --> 00:44:05.495
21 is evidence of the value of this work.

914
00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:10.845
We believe the commercial insurance market in Australia will

915
00:44:10.845 --> 00:44:14.285
face continued change in the next few years driven

916
00:44:14.345 --> 00:44:15.405
by external factors

917
00:44:15.875 --> 00:44:18.485
with our broker partners deploying different strategies

918
00:44:18.825 --> 00:44:20.525
and technology capabilities.

919
00:44:21.745 --> 00:44:23.125
We believe the key attributes

920
00:44:23.665 --> 00:44:26.925
for a successful insurer will be agility, efficiency

921
00:44:26.925 --> 00:44:31.645
and service key external factors that we we will, uh,

922
00:44:31.755 --> 00:44:33.725
that we believe drive change

923
00:44:34.435 --> 00:44:37.245
include an expected softer rate environment.

924
00:44:37.835 --> 00:44:41.085
Further broker consolidation with new entrant driving,

925
00:44:41.085 --> 00:44:44.045
increased competition for talent and customers.

926
00:44:44.775 --> 00:44:47.765
Broad base investment in technology by brokers

927
00:44:47.765 --> 00:44:49.485
to support divergent strategies.

928
00:44:50.445 --> 00:44:53.685
A heightened focus on value that will drive productivity

929
00:44:54.145 --> 00:44:56.965
and cost out across the intermediated value chain

930
00:44:58.145 --> 00:45:00.205
and changing uh, customer preferences

931
00:45:00.795 --> 00:45:02.605
requiring a wider range of digital

932
00:45:03.065 --> 00:45:05.725
and real time automated engagement channels.

933
00:45:08.065 --> 00:45:09.765
We have a really clear strategy

934
00:45:10.585 --> 00:45:12.805
and vision which I'll take you through now

935
00:45:14.565 --> 00:45:18.225
within our platform portfolios distributed via brokers,

936
00:45:18.845 --> 00:45:22.385
we aim to rebuild C G's market share over the medium term.

937
00:45:23.925 --> 00:45:25.985
SME is C G'S traditional heartland

938
00:45:26.795 --> 00:45:30.255
but we do not believe our current market position reflects

939
00:45:30.255 --> 00:45:32.895
the strength of our brand or where we want to be.

940
00:45:34.075 --> 00:45:36.455
We know that we must be more efficient internally

941
00:45:36.995 --> 00:45:38.215
to ensure we continue

942
00:45:38.215 --> 00:45:40.135
to offer competitively priced products.

943
00:45:41.705 --> 00:45:45.215
We'll also reduce frictional cost along the value chain

944
00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:46.975
to support the productivity

945
00:45:47.515 --> 00:45:49.695
and service goals of our broking partners.

946
00:45:50.605 --> 00:45:52.095
Through digital connectivity

947
00:45:52.115 --> 00:45:55.935
and real time responses leading to better customer outcomes,

948
00:45:57.765 --> 00:46:01.545
legacy systems currently inhibit our ability to compete

949
00:46:01.885 --> 00:46:03.745
as effectively as we would like.

950
00:46:04.635 --> 00:46:06.985
We've made strong progress around service delivery

951
00:46:07.785 --> 00:46:10.545
a 30 point uplift in the last 24 months

952
00:46:11.285 --> 00:46:14.425
and now have a pathway to achieve our medium term goals

953
00:46:14.655 --> 00:46:17.225
through a business transformation currently underway.

954
00:46:18.455 --> 00:46:21.625
This transformation includes modernizing our core systems

955
00:46:22.015 --> 00:46:23.985
through the commercial enablement program.

956
00:46:25.885 --> 00:46:29.065
We will launch our first product on this platform padlock

957
00:46:29.605 --> 00:46:31.505
in the fourth quarter of this financial year.

958
00:46:33.395 --> 00:46:36.425
Commercial enablement will also deliver capabilities

959
00:46:36.775 --> 00:46:38.985
that will enhance our proposition in the mid-market.

960
00:46:39.655 --> 00:46:41.065
Corporate underwritten lines

961
00:46:42.155 --> 00:46:45.705
where we require a more bespoke proposition for brokers

962
00:46:46.615 --> 00:46:47.905
through horizon one.

963
00:46:48.445 --> 00:46:50.545
We improved our core insurance capabilities

964
00:46:50.815 --> 00:46:53.225
through a focus on people and process.

965
00:46:54.485 --> 00:46:56.865
By embedding more structured underwriting practices,

966
00:46:57.285 --> 00:47:00.105
we are now now able to regularly assess

967
00:47:00.765 --> 00:47:04.025
and shape our portfolio by focusing on segments

968
00:47:04.335 --> 00:47:06.185
that deliver our target margin

969
00:47:06.845 --> 00:47:08.625
and align with our risk appetite.

970
00:47:10.095 --> 00:47:12.185
This can be evidence as we grow, share

971
00:47:12.445 --> 00:47:15.065
and increase margin in selected underwritten lines

972
00:47:15.065 --> 00:47:16.105
such as ISR.

973
00:47:17.535 --> 00:47:20.545
Further progress we'll rely on augmenting the capability

974
00:47:20.545 --> 00:47:23.465
of our people with modern technology systems

975
00:47:24.295 --> 00:47:27.145
that enable direct connectivity with our partners.

976
00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:30.085
Flexible product options for brokers

977
00:47:30.425 --> 00:47:32.045
to deliver tailored solutions

978
00:47:32.665 --> 00:47:34.565
to their clients more efficiently

979
00:47:35.505 --> 00:47:38.605
and readily accessible data insights that

980
00:47:39.145 --> 00:47:40.685
can be utilized internally

981
00:47:41.105 --> 00:47:45.245
and to share with our brokers from a margin perspective.

982
00:47:45.575 --> 00:47:49.645
Commercial enablement will also provide CGU with agility

983
00:47:49.745 --> 00:47:51.405
to scale portfolios up

984
00:47:51.405 --> 00:47:55.125
and down in response to performance, our risk appetite

985
00:47:55.225 --> 00:47:56.365
and market conditions.

986
00:47:57.625 --> 00:48:01.965
Modern core systems will also enable growth enabling CGU

987
00:48:01.965 --> 00:48:05.365
to quickly deploy new products as customer needs evolve

988
00:48:06.185 --> 00:48:08.885
or market dynamic shift in categories

989
00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:13.645
where we do not play Today I'm very proud

990
00:48:13.645 --> 00:48:16.885
of the turnaround, the WFI team delivered in horizon one

991
00:48:17.505 --> 00:48:19.805
and I believe significant upside remains.

992
00:48:21.045 --> 00:48:24.605
WFI offers a unique model that provides channel divers

993
00:48:25.185 --> 00:48:26.965
diversification for our business.

994
00:48:28.115 --> 00:48:30.645
Through the WFI brand, we're able

995
00:48:30.645 --> 00:48:33.525
to manage the end-to-end proposition delivered to customers

996
00:48:34.265 --> 00:48:36.965
and utilize firsthand risk selection insights

997
00:48:37.515 --> 00:48:39.965
that are unmatched via most other channels.

998
00:48:40.795 --> 00:48:43.685
With our reps aiming to walk the farm

999
00:48:44.225 --> 00:48:45.925
for all WFI customers,

1000
00:48:47.295 --> 00:48:49.995
the WFI story in the coming years will be about volume

1001
00:48:49.995 --> 00:48:52.995
growth and maintaining current margins.

1002
00:48:54.105 --> 00:48:55.635
I've recently brought in new sales

1003
00:48:55.655 --> 00:48:58.955
and distribution leadership to WFI responsible

1004
00:48:59.095 --> 00:49:02.975
for executing on our growth ambitions to grow.

1005
00:49:03.345 --> 00:49:06.295
We'll increase the productivity of our sales representatives

1006
00:49:06.715 --> 00:49:10.055
so they spend more time in the field meeting customer

1007
00:49:10.345 --> 00:49:13.255
where they live and work in their local communities.

1008
00:49:14.275 --> 00:49:16.265
We'll attract new sales representatives

1009
00:49:16.485 --> 00:49:18.745
to bolster our presence in existing communities.

1010
00:49:19.725 --> 00:49:23.825
Expand into new regions will create stronger alignment

1011
00:49:23.965 --> 00:49:28.305
around growth with key existing partners such as Nutrien

1012
00:49:28.565 --> 00:49:30.305
and the various farmers federations.

1013
00:49:32.195 --> 00:49:34.505
While WFI faces similar technology,

1014
00:49:34.505 --> 00:49:36.625
technology related challenges to CGU,

1015
00:49:37.285 --> 00:49:39.825
we still see an opportunity to grow this channel

1016
00:49:40.325 --> 00:49:43.665
as a key component of our perform objectives.

1017
00:49:44.905 --> 00:49:47.585
WFI is also part of our transformation agenda

1018
00:49:48.235 --> 00:49:50.465
being on the commercial enablement roadmap

1019
00:49:51.355 --> 00:49:54.705
where we'll harmonize product pricing underwriting

1020
00:49:54.775 --> 00:49:57.185
disciplines across both brands.

1021
00:50:00.005 --> 00:50:02.705
We intend to develop a market leading claims capability

1022
00:50:03.015 --> 00:50:06.305
that delivers our promise to pay for CGU

1023
00:50:06.305 --> 00:50:09.865
and WFI customers, particularly in their time of need.

1024
00:50:11.005 --> 00:50:12.625
In order to achieve this ambition,

1025
00:50:13.005 --> 00:50:15.665
we must provide industry leading customer experience

1026
00:50:16.295 --> 00:50:19.545
efficiently handle claims to opt optimize claims cost,

1027
00:50:20.005 --> 00:50:21.865
and redesign our processes

1028
00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:24.305
to incorporate emerging technology.

1029
00:50:26.045 --> 00:50:28.045
We are closely tracking NPS scores

1030
00:50:28.585 --> 00:50:30.685
and have set clear targets for the team.

1031
00:50:31.505 --> 00:50:35.845
We monitor both monitor NPS for both customers and brokers.

1032
00:50:37.265 --> 00:50:40.205
By utilizing data to closely monitor the performance

1033
00:50:40.205 --> 00:50:43.125
of our claims team, we're able to leverage insights

1034
00:50:43.835 --> 00:50:47.125
that help us proactively enhance underwriting decisions,

1035
00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:51.165
manage response times to ensure we're meeting expectations

1036
00:50:51.165 --> 00:50:52.685
of our customers and stakeholders.

1037
00:50:54.045 --> 00:50:56.645
Identify opportunities for internal process improvement

1038
00:50:56.945 --> 00:50:58.325
and operational excellence

1039
00:50:59.305 --> 00:51:00.805
and understand the evolving needs

1040
00:51:00.805 --> 00:51:02.685
of customers including engagement

1041
00:51:03.145 --> 00:51:07.965
and channel of choice preferences flexibly allocate capital

1042
00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:10.725
and funding to deploy technology around use cases

1043
00:51:11.355 --> 00:51:13.205
that deliver the highest ROI

1044
00:51:15.625 --> 00:51:17.725
In horizon one, we exceeded our target

1045
00:51:17.745 --> 00:51:19.485
to deliver two 50 million insurance profit

1046
00:51:20.075 --> 00:51:21.645
from a solid earnings base.

1047
00:51:21.695 --> 00:51:24.125
Today we're now in the early stages

1048
00:51:24.265 --> 00:51:27.405
of transforming I I A into Australia's leading

1049
00:51:27.405 --> 00:51:28.885
intermediated insurer.

1050
00:51:30.265 --> 00:51:33.645
I'm conscious of the challenge we face to succeed.

1051
00:51:34.225 --> 00:51:36.965
We must manage the change associated with transformation

1052
00:51:36.965 --> 00:51:41.605
for our people, absorb the cost of core

1053
00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:45.445
platform modernization while meeting our financial goals

1054
00:51:47.345 --> 00:51:49.285
and navigate portfolio performance

1055
00:51:49.705 --> 00:51:52.485
as we enter a transitional commercial insurance

1056
00:51:52.485 --> 00:51:55.275
market to be successful.

1057
00:51:55.275 --> 00:51:57.875
Over the medium term we'll become more agile

1058
00:51:58.255 --> 00:52:00.915
and innovative in the way we engage with brokers

1059
00:52:01.415 --> 00:52:04.875
and customers while maintaining strong underwriting

1060
00:52:04.885 --> 00:52:07.675
discipline driven by data based analytics

1061
00:52:07.935 --> 00:52:11.715
and decisions we are committed to continuing

1062
00:52:11.715 --> 00:52:13.435
to deliver margin improvement

1063
00:52:13.895 --> 00:52:15.835
and this remains my primary focus.

1064
00:52:17.695 --> 00:52:20.435
I'm optimistic about the opportunities head for IA

1065
00:52:21.255 --> 00:52:24.275
and confident we deliver against our plans.

1066
00:52:25.545 --> 00:52:28.155
With that, I'll now pass to Amanda Whiting

1067
00:52:28.155 --> 00:52:29.315
for an update on New Zealand.

1068
00:52:29.445 --> 00:52:30.445
Thank you.

1069
00:52:35.095 --> 00:52:38.275
Thanks Jared and Tenco two car Cara.

1070
00:52:38.845 --> 00:52:40.635
Today I am really delighted to be able to share

1071
00:52:40.635 --> 00:52:42.515
with you an update on New Zealand's strategy.

1072
00:52:43.435 --> 00:52:45.715
I feel really confident about the direction in which we are

1073
00:52:45.715 --> 00:52:48.595
heading and we've made great strides in the delivery

1074
00:52:48.935 --> 00:52:51.035
of our strategy over the last 18 months.

1075
00:52:52.295 --> 00:52:55.435
We are the market leader in New Zealand, serving in one one,

1076
00:52:55.515 --> 00:52:59.275
sorry, serving one in every two households and a MI

1077
00:52:59.275 --> 00:53:02.315
and state are the first and third largest direct brands.

1078
00:53:02.975 --> 00:53:05.875
We are the trusted brand for three of the largest banks also

1079
00:53:06.295 --> 00:53:08.075
and in the intermediated market,

1080
00:53:08.395 --> 00:53:11.835
NZI is building on its legacy of over 165 years

1081
00:53:12.215 --> 00:53:14.155
to be the leading brand for brokers

1082
00:53:14.945 --> 00:53:17.195
that gives us tremendous reach and scale

1083
00:53:17.655 --> 00:53:19.955
and our opportunities to reach new customers

1084
00:53:20.255 --> 00:53:22.715
and deepen our relationship with existing customers.

1085
00:53:23.285 --> 00:53:25.925
We'll do that by utilizing our connected ecosystem

1086
00:53:26.345 --> 00:53:30.165
to support customers beyond insurance, remove pain points

1087
00:53:30.345 --> 00:53:32.925
and connect them via one mobile app.

1088
00:53:33.985 --> 00:53:36.485
Now just briefly reflecting on our journey so far,

1089
00:53:36.915 --> 00:53:39.285
I've been in the role since July 21

1090
00:53:39.905 --> 00:53:41.405
and it was clear to me at that time

1091
00:53:41.515 --> 00:53:44.445
that the opportunity here is to maintain

1092
00:53:44.705 --> 00:53:48.525
and grow our insurance business, but we also had the brands

1093
00:53:48.625 --> 00:53:52.365
and the volumes to to expand our adjacency services

1094
00:53:53.065 --> 00:53:54.445
And over the last three years

1095
00:53:54.975 --> 00:53:58.165
we've expanded the offering well beyond collision repair

1096
00:53:58.585 --> 00:54:01.365
and demonstrated we can deliver an exceptional customer

1097
00:54:01.365 --> 00:54:03.045
experience at lower cost.

1098
00:54:04.345 --> 00:54:06.085
We built confidence in our ability

1099
00:54:06.145 --> 00:54:09.285
to execute on this connected ecosystem strategy

1100
00:54:09.705 --> 00:54:11.765
and I'll talk more about that shortly.

1101
00:54:12.555 --> 00:54:13.765
Over the last couple of years,

1102
00:54:13.815 --> 00:54:16.765
we've also faced into some challenging external operating

1103
00:54:16.765 --> 00:54:18.645
conditions and I'm proud to say

1104
00:54:18.645 --> 00:54:20.725
that we've led the market in our response

1105
00:54:20.845 --> 00:54:25.285
to the Cyclone Gabrielle and Auckland flood events of 2023.

1106
00:54:26.145 --> 00:54:27.485
We also moved really quickly

1107
00:54:27.625 --> 00:54:29.405
to uplift our pricing capability

1108
00:54:29.985 --> 00:54:32.365
to enable more granular risk-based pricing

1109
00:54:32.905 --> 00:54:34.845
and respond to inflationary pressures.

1110
00:54:35.435 --> 00:54:36.685
It's important to say though

1111
00:54:36.685 --> 00:54:38.765
that those events have not distracted us.

1112
00:54:39.335 --> 00:54:42.245
We've continued to make solid progress on delivering our

1113
00:54:42.245 --> 00:54:44.245
transformation and the pace

1114
00:54:44.245 --> 00:54:46.205
of our delivery model has accelerated

1115
00:54:46.545 --> 00:54:49.165
and we are now dropping new capabilities every week.

1116
00:54:50.825 --> 00:54:53.965
So looking forward to the operating environment over the

1117
00:54:53.965 --> 00:54:56.045
next five years, we forecast

1118
00:54:56.045 --> 00:54:58.525
that there's positive system growth in the one

1119
00:54:58.525 --> 00:55:00.125
to 2% range per annum.

1120
00:55:00.745 --> 00:55:04.045
And while our population is aging compared

1121
00:55:04.045 --> 00:55:07.125
to other OECD countries, New Zealand will still have one

1122
00:55:07.125 --> 00:55:10.965
of the lower average ages at 38 by 2030.

1123
00:55:11.425 --> 00:55:14.565
And that's important because the younger cohort are still

1124
00:55:14.565 --> 00:55:17.085
growing their asset base, which leads

1125
00:55:17.085 --> 00:55:20.685
to higher insurance needs in the insurance landscape.

1126
00:55:20.705 --> 00:55:23.605
On the commercial side, we're entering a softer cycle

1127
00:55:23.995 --> 00:55:25.885
with an inflow of offshore capital

1128
00:55:26.185 --> 00:55:29.125
and more managed general agencies launching in New Zealand

1129
00:55:29.865 --> 00:55:32.245
to address that NZI will continue

1130
00:55:32.265 --> 00:55:34.965
to execute strong underwriting discipline.

1131
00:55:35.455 --> 00:55:37.285
We'll use our long tenure relationships

1132
00:55:37.385 --> 00:55:40.325
and deep expertise in the market to make sure

1133
00:55:40.325 --> 00:55:42.165
that we can trade on the value that we bring

1134
00:55:42.305 --> 00:55:43.525
and not just the price.

1135
00:55:44.955 --> 00:55:47.285
Looking at future customer trends, we know

1136
00:55:47.285 --> 00:55:49.325
that customers expectations of a seamless

1137
00:55:49.665 --> 00:55:52.485
and satisfying digital experience will be non-negotiable.

1138
00:55:53.425 --> 00:55:55.525
By 2030, nearly half

1139
00:55:55.525 --> 00:55:59.525
of our population will come from the millennial Gen Z

1140
00:55:59.585 --> 00:56:01.365
and Gen Alpha cohorts

1141
00:56:01.865 --> 00:56:04.525
and the majority of customer interactions will occur on

1142
00:56:04.525 --> 00:56:05.605
mobile platforms.

1143
00:56:06.305 --> 00:56:08.645
So continually investing in the digital platform

1144
00:56:09.105 --> 00:56:11.925
by our own mobile apps is an absolute must for us.

1145
00:56:12.505 --> 00:56:14.885
We have a mobile app experience in market today

1146
00:56:15.225 --> 00:56:18.125
and it's currently the only general insurance app in

1147
00:56:18.145 --> 00:56:21.245
New Zealand and we'll continue, continue to build that out

1148
00:56:21.475 --> 00:56:24.445
with our customer offerings via the app to retain

1149
00:56:24.445 --> 00:56:25.725
that market leading position.

1150
00:56:27.305 --> 00:56:29.565
So what does all that mean for our New Zealand business?

1151
00:56:30.235 --> 00:56:31.365
Well, our ambition is

1152
00:56:31.365 --> 00:56:35.005
to become a connected customer business beyond insurance.

1153
00:56:35.975 --> 00:56:37.725
We've got strong brand loyalty today,

1154
00:56:38.265 --> 00:56:41.285
but we know that insurance is a low engagement product,

1155
00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:44.165
so we're constantly paying attention to that.

1156
00:56:45.025 --> 00:56:46.685
We are shifting from offering insurance

1157
00:56:46.715 --> 00:56:48.005
with limited touch points

1158
00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:51.125
to a connected business offering multiple services

1159
00:56:51.825 --> 00:56:53.685
and these need to meet customers' needs,

1160
00:56:54.095 --> 00:56:57.125
offer outstanding customer experiences, engage

1161
00:56:57.125 --> 00:57:00.045
with customers more frequently and more meaningfully,

1162
00:57:00.505 --> 00:57:02.885
and help deepen those customer relationships

1163
00:57:03.225 --> 00:57:04.485
and reach new customers.

1164
00:57:04.945 --> 00:57:06.485
And of course that will all result in

1165
00:57:06.625 --> 00:57:07.885
higher retention levels.

1166
00:57:08.395 --> 00:57:09.845
More items per customer

1167
00:57:10.185 --> 00:57:13.525
and more customers joining us via non-insurance services.

1168
00:57:14.035 --> 00:57:18.725
Alongside increased brand consideration, our strategies,

1169
00:57:18.735 --> 00:57:20.085
strategies strategy's gonna be delivered

1170
00:57:20.085 --> 00:57:23.685
by our two distinct retail brands, our connected ecosystem

1171
00:57:24.185 --> 00:57:27.005
and our strong reputation through our NZI brand.

1172
00:57:27.625 --> 00:57:30.085
All enabled by our continued transformation.

1173
00:57:30.585 --> 00:57:31.965
And I'll just take you through each

1174
00:57:31.965 --> 00:57:33.445
of the components of that strategy.

1175
00:57:35.585 --> 00:57:38.925
So we've got strong brands offering distinctive proposition

1176
00:57:39.025 --> 00:57:41.725
in market amongst consumers.

1177
00:57:41.725 --> 00:57:43.685
We're seeing a real bifurcation of needs

1178
00:57:43.685 --> 00:57:46.165
between those being really highly price sensitive

1179
00:57:46.585 --> 00:57:49.925
and those customers still wanting differentiated value.

1180
00:57:50.465 --> 00:57:54.645
And for us, owning two large direct retail brands of a MI

1181
00:57:54.645 --> 00:57:56.645
and state allows us to appeal

1182
00:57:56.705 --> 00:57:59.045
to different customer groups while still

1183
00:57:59.045 --> 00:58:00.525
retaining scale efficiency.

1184
00:58:01.525 --> 00:58:04.005
A MI is our full service brand offering.

1185
00:58:04.465 --> 00:58:08.045
It has premium personalized services, it has a full suite

1186
00:58:08.225 --> 00:58:11.165
of insurance, uh, products from mainstream to niche

1187
00:58:11.425 --> 00:58:12.485
and has a range

1188
00:58:12.485 --> 00:58:16.565
of highly relevant adjacent services from our A MI hubs

1189
00:58:17.155 --> 00:58:20.685
alongside a new loyalty reward recognition

1190
00:58:20.685 --> 00:58:23.205
and engagement PLA platform to make sure

1191
00:58:23.205 --> 00:58:25.605
that our customers connect all of our insurance

1192
00:58:25.905 --> 00:58:29.205
and a MI hub service offerings together for customers

1193
00:58:30.735 --> 00:58:34.525
state will be the simplifier focusing on straightforward low

1194
00:58:34.525 --> 00:58:37.685
cost insurance that's just easy to understand, easy

1195
00:58:37.705 --> 00:58:41.285
to purchase and offers a best in class digital experience

1196
00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:44.445
and we're already demonstrating success.

1197
00:58:45.025 --> 00:58:47.645
So a MI won the s of general insurer of the year a couple

1198
00:58:47.645 --> 00:58:51.365
of weeks ago and state won the CANSTAR best value car

1199
00:58:51.365 --> 00:58:54.205
insurance award as well as the overall car insurer

1200
00:58:54.205 --> 00:58:55.205
of the year award this year.

1201
00:58:57.225 --> 00:58:59.565
As I said before, we're continuing to expand

1202
00:58:59.705 --> 00:59:02.605
beyond insurance and are building out our connected

1203
00:59:02.605 --> 00:59:04.925
ecosystem, which is led by the A MI brand.

1204
00:59:05.265 --> 00:59:08.205
And this year we've branded all of our physical assets

1205
00:59:08.265 --> 00:59:09.845
to a MI In effect.

1206
00:59:10.385 --> 00:59:12.285
We have around 800 moving

1207
00:59:12.425 --> 00:59:15.365
and fixed bill billboards and they're everywhere.

1208
00:59:16.295 --> 00:59:18.365
We're providing approximately $30 million

1209
00:59:18.385 --> 00:59:19.965
of marketing benefit annually

1210
00:59:21.065 --> 00:59:24.045
and every business in the ecosystem is about delivering an

1211
00:59:24.045 --> 00:59:25.405
outstanding customer service

1212
00:59:26.065 --> 00:59:27.485
and Wayne will be sharing more on

1213
00:59:27.485 --> 00:59:30.245
that in our A MI ecosystem showcase shortly.

1214
00:59:31.905 --> 00:59:33.565
In addition to deepening relationships

1215
00:59:33.565 --> 00:59:35.165
with existing insurance customers,

1216
00:59:35.255 --> 00:59:37.925
we're also offering standalone propositions

1217
00:59:38.305 --> 00:59:40.885
to build connections with non-insurance customers.

1218
00:59:41.355 --> 00:59:44.365
Earlier this year we launched a MI roadside rescue

1219
00:59:44.545 --> 00:59:45.685
to all New Zealanders

1220
00:59:45.985 --> 00:59:48.845
and most recently our new driver promotion

1221
00:59:48.845 --> 00:59:51.525
of offering a free year of roadside rescue

1222
00:59:51.665 --> 00:59:53.485
to all new license holders in New Zealand

1223
00:59:54.115 --> 00:59:56.645
that will bring those new drivers into our ecosystem.

1224
00:59:57.985 --> 01:00:01.085
As we look forward, we'll continue to expand our presence

1225
01:00:01.225 --> 01:00:03.085
and the breadth of services that we offer here,

1226
01:00:03.505 --> 01:00:06.645
but they'll all be housed in that 1:00 AM I mobile app,

1227
01:00:07.285 --> 01:00:08.845
allowing for customers to connect with us

1228
01:00:08.945 --> 01:00:10.845
for all their needs in one location.

1229
01:00:12.865 --> 01:00:17.245
Moving now to N-Z-I-N-Z-I is the leading commercial insurer

1230
01:00:17.245 --> 01:00:19.925
in New Zealand, underpinning this as strong

1231
01:00:19.925 --> 01:00:22.285
and long lasting relationships with our broker partners

1232
01:00:22.665 --> 01:00:24.165
and increasingly with customers

1233
01:00:24.465 --> 01:00:25.925
and that's to support brokers

1234
01:00:25.945 --> 01:00:27.845
and add value in that corporate market.

1235
01:00:28.885 --> 01:00:30.565
Secondly, we're continuing to deliver

1236
01:00:30.665 --> 01:00:32.885
and invest in our leading claims experience.

1237
01:00:33.315 --> 01:00:35.445
It's a crucial time for customers

1238
01:00:35.745 --> 01:00:37.685
and a real strength of the broker model.

1239
01:00:38.505 --> 01:00:40.885
We we're continually innovating our processes

1240
01:00:40.885 --> 01:00:43.365
and digital offerings through greater empowerment,

1241
01:00:43.365 --> 01:00:46.485
empowerment of brokers so that they can speed up their claim

1242
01:00:46.945 --> 01:00:49.245
and utilizing digital lodgement connectivity

1243
01:00:49.425 --> 01:00:53.805
and AI to enable faster and more consistent decision making.

1244
01:00:54.925 --> 01:00:57.805
A key differentiator for NZI are the assurance propositions

1245
01:00:57.805 --> 01:00:59.845
that really help our customers reduce their risk

1246
01:01:00.185 --> 01:01:02.005
and that's a win-win for everyone.

1247
01:01:03.225 --> 01:01:06.925
Our commercial transport offering fleet fit is accessed

1248
01:01:06.925 --> 01:01:08.965
by almost a third of our corporate book

1249
01:01:09.345 --> 01:01:12.765
and our electrical inspector service is in its second year

1250
01:01:13.185 --> 01:01:17.085
and we've already identified 2,700 electrical defects

1251
01:01:17.465 --> 01:01:20.005
and reduced the risk for 300 businesses.

1252
01:01:20.865 --> 01:01:22.965
We also provide up guard to customers

1253
01:01:22.965 --> 01:01:25.205
to help detect vulnerability to cyber losses

1254
01:01:25.865 --> 01:01:28.485
and we're continually looking for ways to support brokers

1255
01:01:28.485 --> 01:01:30.605
and customers reduce risk

1256
01:01:30.605 --> 01:01:32.125
through our assurance propositions.

1257
01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:35.205
Our aspiration for 2030 is

1258
01:01:35.205 --> 01:01:38.285
to have a modern platform leading data capabilities

1259
01:01:38.545 --> 01:01:42.165
and AI capabilities to support, to support brokers so

1260
01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:44.005
that they are efficient, connected

1261
01:01:44.265 --> 01:01:45.485
and we've got improved pricing

1262
01:01:45.485 --> 01:01:46.725
and underwriting for the customer.

1263
01:01:47.855 --> 01:01:50.405
We'll maintain and grow our leadership position here

1264
01:01:50.705 --> 01:01:53.685
by delivering this in tranches over the next five years.

1265
01:01:55.475 --> 01:01:58.445
Finally, New Zealand is making good progress in the delivery

1266
01:01:58.465 --> 01:01:59.565
of our transformation.

1267
01:01:59.835 --> 01:02:01.805
It's all about improving customer experience

1268
01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:03.405
and delivering efficiency benefits.

1269
01:02:03.825 --> 01:02:08.085
We have over 360,000 policies on the enterprise platform

1270
01:02:08.345 --> 01:02:12.005
across state, a MI and two of our four bank partners.

1271
01:02:12.425 --> 01:02:13.725
And one of the key benefits

1272
01:02:13.725 --> 01:02:17.445
of enterprise platform is the pricing capability uplift.

1273
01:02:18.065 --> 01:02:21.085
And we are already evidencing improved new business quote

1274
01:02:21.235 --> 01:02:23.565
conversions and better risk selection

1275
01:02:23.835 --> 01:02:25.325
that we'll continue to optimize.

1276
01:02:26.025 --> 01:02:27.205
But that's only the beginning

1277
01:02:27.205 --> 01:02:28.325
because we'll continue

1278
01:02:28.325 --> 01:02:30.605
to see more uplift in our digital capability

1279
01:02:30.945 --> 01:02:33.885
as we optimize the end-to-end customer experience journeys

1280
01:02:34.025 --> 01:02:38.205
and embed ai, we're already demonstrating the benefits

1281
01:02:38.205 --> 01:02:40.165
of being on that single modern platform

1282
01:02:40.165 --> 01:02:41.565
that Neil talked about for claims

1283
01:02:42.145 --> 01:02:44.045
and we've reduced customer pain points.

1284
01:02:44.095 --> 01:02:47.125
We've automated over 80,000 thousand man hours

1285
01:02:47.505 --> 01:02:50.285
and we've created AI pilots from that single platform.

1286
01:02:51.015 --> 01:02:53.285
We've also been able to introduce claims process

1287
01:02:53.605 --> 01:02:57.205
optimization such as through our segmented claims program

1288
01:02:57.825 --> 01:03:00.525
and that's reduced the time taken to close simple claims.

1289
01:03:01.065 --> 01:03:04.085
So previously it took us 28 days on average

1290
01:03:04.585 --> 01:03:08.285
and now over 80% are closed in less than three days.

1291
01:03:09.225 --> 01:03:11.445
The number of customer interactions required in now down

1292
01:03:11.745 --> 01:03:13.565
and customers are acknowledging this

1293
01:03:13.565 --> 01:03:15.285
with our customer PS scores.

1294
01:03:15.475 --> 01:03:16.805
They're sitting above 60

1295
01:03:16.945 --> 01:03:18.805
and they're actually getting better every week,

1296
01:03:19.215 --> 01:03:22.445
which is exceptionally high by financial service standards.

1297
01:03:23.945 --> 01:03:27.445
In the last year, NZ has made significant progress on

1298
01:03:27.645 --> 01:03:31.405
building one unified data ecosystem that provides us

1299
01:03:31.405 --> 01:03:35.045
with a single view of customer data really is the key

1300
01:03:35.305 --> 01:03:36.925
to success in this strategy

1301
01:03:37.385 --> 01:03:40.725
and it enables a deeper understanding of our customers so

1302
01:03:40.725 --> 01:03:42.645
that we can deliver personalized engagement

1303
01:03:43.105 --> 01:03:47.245
and connected experiences seamlessly across all touchpoints.

1304
01:03:48.105 --> 01:03:50.525
Our single data platform accelerates our ability

1305
01:03:50.525 --> 01:03:52.445
to deploy AI across the business.

1306
01:03:52.985 --> 01:03:56.285
And some examples already imply are a knowledge management

1307
01:03:56.355 --> 01:03:57.605
tool, which is, uh,

1308
01:03:57.605 --> 01:04:00.685
help helping agents check eligibility against our policy

1309
01:04:00.685 --> 01:04:03.525
statement or our image capture tool,

1310
01:04:03.735 --> 01:04:07.685
which is enabling desk-based assessment versus the physical

1311
01:04:07.685 --> 01:04:08.965
visit by an assessor.

1312
01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:11.645
And that results in a faster claims

1313
01:04:11.655 --> 01:04:13.405
experience and reduce cost.

1314
01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:18.285
In addition to ai, we've also got new machine learning tools

1315
01:04:18.475 --> 01:04:21.405
such as a predictive model to help us identify customers

1316
01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:23.645
who might churn and that enables us

1317
01:04:23.645 --> 01:04:25.325
to proactively respond to that.

1318
01:04:25.985 --> 01:04:28.765
And we've seen a significant acceleration in our

1319
01:04:28.825 --> 01:04:31.205
transformation delivery in the last 18 months.

1320
01:04:31.875 --> 01:04:34.565
This momentum is going to grow as we continue new

1321
01:04:34.565 --> 01:04:39.165
to invest in digital data and ai and we built new skills

1322
01:04:39.225 --> 01:04:40.645
and capabilities in the business.

1323
01:04:41.335 --> 01:04:42.725
We're driving cultural change

1324
01:04:43.345 --> 01:04:45.605
and we have a pathway for an ZI

1325
01:04:45.625 --> 01:04:47.885
to modernize our intermediated business.

1326
01:04:49.305 --> 01:04:52.725
In summary, IAG has a unique leadership position in

1327
01:04:52.725 --> 01:04:55.685
New Zealand that business is achieving strong results

1328
01:04:55.785 --> 01:04:57.845
as we deliver on our connected customer strategy.

1329
01:04:58.505 --> 01:05:02.045
And as we look forward to 2030, we'll build our data

1330
01:05:02.045 --> 01:05:05.925
and AI capabilities, continue to digitize our business,

1331
01:05:06.555 --> 01:05:10.765
deliver a leading claims experience, provide a range

1332
01:05:10.765 --> 01:05:14.045
of assurance services, support customers

1333
01:05:14.115 --> 01:05:15.565
through climate transition,

1334
01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:18.485
and that's all in the service of connecting

1335
01:05:18.585 --> 01:05:20.245
and growing our customer base.

1336
01:05:21.625 --> 01:05:23.365
So thank you very much for listening

1337
01:05:23.365 --> 01:05:24.605
to all our business updates.

1338
01:05:24.635 --> 01:05:26.405
That brings us to the end of those,

1339
01:05:27.145 --> 01:05:30.325
but I'm now, I've now got the wonderful job of giving you,

1340
01:05:30.505 --> 01:05:32.805
um, instructions for how to move downstairs

1341
01:05:33.025 --> 01:05:34.445
to see our showcases.

1342
01:05:35.145 --> 01:05:37.725
So we're going to move downstairs for those online.

1343
01:05:37.855 --> 01:05:41.325
We'll be pausing our webcast and we'll resume at 1130.

1344
01:05:41.825 --> 01:05:43.405
And that will be for an update

1345
01:05:43.405 --> 01:05:45.085
with our CFO William McDonald.

1346
01:05:45.425 --> 01:05:47.565
And that'll then be followed as Nick said, by a q

1347
01:05:47.565 --> 01:05:49.085
and a session with all of our speakers.

1348
01:05:49.545 --> 01:05:52.325
So for everyone here in the room, we'll now head downstairs,

1349
01:05:52.985 --> 01:05:54.405
you've got a name tag,

1350
01:05:54.405 --> 01:05:56.325
and on that you'll see you're split into two groups.

1351
01:05:57.325 --> 01:05:59.645
Everyone for the blue group, that's group one.

1352
01:05:59.705 --> 01:06:01.845
You'll start with the customer experience showcase.

1353
01:06:02.585 --> 01:06:05.925
And for the purple group group two, you'll start

1354
01:06:05.925 --> 01:06:07.165
with the Innovation showcase

1355
01:06:07.545 --> 01:06:09.605
and there'll be people around to guide you. So thank you.

1356
01:06:10.095 --> 01:06:12.925
Hello everyone, and uh, welcome back to those

1357
01:06:13.445 --> 01:06:14.445
watching on the webcast.

1358
01:06:15.485 --> 01:06:18.685
Everyone here has just seen our showcases on customer

1359
01:06:18.685 --> 01:06:20.405
experience and innovation.

1360
01:06:21.185 --> 01:06:22.365
Um, if you are online

1361
01:06:22.585 --> 01:06:24.085
and are interested in these topics,

1362
01:06:24.275 --> 01:06:27.085
then please contact our investor relations team.

1363
01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:32.045
I'll start today by discussing our strong capital

1364
01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:34.885
foundations, which are of course anchored

1365
01:06:35.225 --> 01:06:38.445
by our robust target capital ranges as a multiple

1366
01:06:38.545 --> 01:06:40.365
of regulatory capital minimum levels,

1367
01:06:41.265 --> 01:06:43.525
and by our approach to capital allocation,

1368
01:06:43.655 --> 01:06:45.245
which I will speak to shortly.

1369
01:06:46.945 --> 01:06:49.205
As a result of our approach to capital management,

1370
01:06:49.575 --> 01:06:51.725
we've been able to invest in our technology.

1371
01:06:52.255 --> 01:06:55.245
We've seen an upgrade to our s and p credit rating,

1372
01:06:55.825 --> 01:06:58.085
and we've been able to return surplus capital

1373
01:06:58.185 --> 01:07:00.845
to shareholders via on market buybacks.

1374
01:07:02.505 --> 01:07:05.445
Our overall capital approach is to have a capital platform

1375
01:07:05.445 --> 01:07:09.285
that's diversified by counterparty duration

1376
01:07:09.465 --> 01:07:13.725
and type of capital, and with a mix of reinsurance equity

1377
01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:16.965
and debt in managing hybrid capital,

1378
01:07:17.105 --> 01:07:19.525
we actively monitor opportunities to allow us

1379
01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:22.085
to refinance ahead of any call dates.

1380
01:07:23.785 --> 01:07:26.365
Our diverse range of reinsurance, in particular,

1381
01:07:26.785 --> 01:07:29.365
has allowed us to reduce earnings, volatility,

1382
01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:30.805
and capital requirements.

1383
01:07:32.235 --> 01:07:33.805
I've illustrated on this slide,

1384
01:07:33.985 --> 01:07:36.725
our capital efficiency over the last 10 years,

1385
01:07:38.275 --> 01:07:39.765
Despite an uptick due

1386
01:07:39.765 --> 01:07:43.485
to the business interruption provision in FY 21, the trend

1387
01:07:43.625 --> 01:07:47.965
of prescribed capital to GWP has declined from

1388
01:07:47.965 --> 01:07:52.365
around 25% in FY 15 to approximately 15%.

1389
01:07:52.505 --> 01:07:55.205
Now, this has been driven by

1390
01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:59.565
i's innovative reinsurance arrangements, the original whole

1391
01:07:59.565 --> 01:08:00.765
of account quota share deals

1392
01:08:01.525 --> 01:08:03.125
provided the foundation for us

1393
01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:07.245
to agree the long-term perils volatility protection in June.

1394
01:08:08.545 --> 01:08:10.485
Of course, it's not just shareholders

1395
01:08:10.485 --> 01:08:11.725
that benefit from this cover,

1396
01:08:12.095 --> 01:08:14.925
it'll also provide greater certainty over the cost of,

1397
01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:16.965
of natural perils cover for our customers.

1398
01:08:18.715 --> 01:08:20.885
Turning to strategic capital allocation,

1399
01:08:21.825 --> 01:08:24.485
we have a disciplined focus on allocating capital

1400
01:08:24.665 --> 01:08:27.085
to achieve higher and more stable returns.

1401
01:08:27.795 --> 01:08:30.565
This includes how we enhance capital efficiency

1402
01:08:30.565 --> 01:08:31.685
and reduce volatility,

1403
01:08:32.145 --> 01:08:36.165
and how we selectively redeploy any capital we release

1404
01:08:36.475 --> 01:08:37.885
through these activities

1405
01:08:38.105 --> 01:08:42.165
and capital that we generate organically on our journey

1406
01:08:42.345 --> 01:08:44.685
to progressively reduce earnings volatility.

1407
01:08:45.305 --> 01:08:48.245
I'm keen to explore our next best step in applying

1408
01:08:48.825 --> 01:08:50.325
i's capital Lights strategy.

1409
01:08:51.955 --> 01:08:53.605
I've examined the various divisions

1410
01:08:53.605 --> 01:08:56.605
for their capital intensity and earnings volatility.

1411
01:08:57.845 --> 01:08:59.165
I I a essentially,

1412
01:08:59.265 --> 01:09:02.605
our commercial insurance business in Australia currently has

1413
01:09:02.625 --> 01:09:04.285
the highest capital intensity

1414
01:09:04.945 --> 01:09:06.645
in our group relative to retail.

1415
01:09:06.645 --> 01:09:09.725
It, it's got a good, it's got quite a, a modest, uh,

1416
01:09:09.725 --> 01:09:12.285
capital intensity relative to, uh,

1417
01:09:12.295 --> 01:09:13.885
other commercial insurers.

1418
01:09:14.465 --> 01:09:17.805
Um, and this is, uh, despite the, it, its, its,

1419
01:09:17.945 --> 01:09:20.485
its intensity is a little bit higher despite the capital

1420
01:09:20.485 --> 01:09:23.885
benefit of the adverse development cover on long tail

1421
01:09:23.885 --> 01:09:25.765
reserves that we purchased in June.

1422
01:09:26.865 --> 01:09:30.045
And despite our strong underwriting expertise,

1423
01:09:30.325 --> 01:09:33.645
I a A also has higher earnings volatility due

1424
01:09:33.645 --> 01:09:34.885
to the inherent variability

1425
01:09:35.225 --> 01:09:37.925
of large commercial losses compared with retail.

1426
01:09:39.195 --> 01:09:41.245
Accordingly, we are considering how

1427
01:09:41.245 --> 01:09:43.085
to apply alternative capital

1428
01:09:43.105 --> 01:09:46.405
and reinsurance structures to i i a as the next opportunity

1429
01:09:46.745 --> 01:09:49.005
to reduce the overall group volatility.

1430
01:09:50.275 --> 01:09:52.485
This work will leverage the separate license

1431
01:09:52.595 --> 01:09:53.885
that we're currently working on,

1432
01:09:54.055 --> 01:09:56.805
which facilitates our supplying tailored approaches.

1433
01:09:58.625 --> 01:10:00.005
In terms of deploying capital,

1434
01:10:00.265 --> 01:10:02.965
we allocate capital selectively to support growth,

1435
01:10:03.225 --> 01:10:06.165
to invest in technology to transform the business.

1436
01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:08.885
And from time to time we invest in m

1437
01:10:08.885 --> 01:10:11.765
and a as we demonstrated with RACQ,

1438
01:10:11.785 --> 01:10:15.045
we have a disciplined approach to inorganic acquisitions.

1439
01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:18.605
Any transaction must be strategically aligned

1440
01:10:18.945 --> 01:10:22.805
and deliver our financial hurdles as Nick described earlier.

1441
01:10:24.515 --> 01:10:27.445
Importantly, we want to minimize the balance sheet impact

1442
01:10:27.445 --> 01:10:30.205
and not add significant goodwill to the balance sheet.

1443
01:10:31.945 --> 01:10:33.485
We demonstrated last Thursday

1444
01:10:33.485 --> 01:10:36.085
that our strong capital position allowed us

1445
01:10:36.105 --> 01:10:38.885
to fund the RACQ acquisition without the

1446
01:10:38.885 --> 01:10:39.925
need for an equity raise.

1447
01:10:40.665 --> 01:10:43.725
On this slide, I've shown the pro forma capital

1448
01:10:44.005 --> 01:10:45.165
position at 30th of June.

1449
01:10:46.065 --> 01:10:49.485
It includes the $150 million benefit from the perils

1450
01:10:49.485 --> 01:10:53.125
volatility protection, which has now been recognized by a PR

1451
01:10:53.465 --> 01:10:56.925
and also the 37 million in on market buybacks

1452
01:10:56.925 --> 01:10:58.445
that we completed year to date.

1453
01:11:00.185 --> 01:11:03.805
The RACQ acquisition will impact our CET one

1454
01:11:03.905 --> 01:11:06.125
by an estimated 21 points,

1455
01:11:06.435 --> 01:11:09.645
leaving us comfortably within our target CET one range

1456
01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:11.965
of N 0.9 to 1.1 times.

1457
01:11:13.755 --> 01:11:16.405
It's important to note that the pro forma capital position

1458
01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:18.125
is as at last year end,

1459
01:11:18.185 --> 01:11:21.965
and so does not recognize any benefit from our strong FY

1460
01:11:21.965 --> 01:11:23.565
25 earnings to date.

1461
01:11:24.585 --> 01:11:25.645
We also have other sources

1462
01:11:25.705 --> 01:11:28.725
of capital generation from the utilization of tax losses

1463
01:11:29.225 --> 01:11:33.485
and a possible future release from the $380 million business

1464
01:11:33.485 --> 01:11:34.685
interruption provision.

1465
01:11:36.785 --> 01:11:39.235
Turning to expenses, I'll unpack

1466
01:11:39.235 --> 01:11:40.515
for you some of the moving parts.

1467
01:11:41.045 --> 01:11:43.115
There are pressures on our cost base,

1468
01:11:43.545 --> 01:11:44.875
primarily from technology

1469
01:11:45.335 --> 01:11:47.995
and the investments we're making to support future growth.

1470
01:11:49.005 --> 01:11:51.195
These will be offset by process

1471
01:11:51.415 --> 01:11:54.595
and efficiency benefits, reducing the proportion of premiums

1472
01:11:54.705 --> 01:11:57.235
that it takes to maintain and run IAG

1473
01:11:57.535 --> 01:12:01.195
and allowing us to invest more in growth transformation

1474
01:12:01.255 --> 01:12:02.515
and customer initiatives.

1475
01:12:03.575 --> 01:12:06.195
As you've heard today, the management team has a strong

1476
01:12:06.205 --> 01:12:09.235
focus on improving efficiency and productivity.

1477
01:12:10.415 --> 01:12:14.075
For example, Neil detailed our consolidated technology

1478
01:12:14.415 --> 01:12:16.715
and how automation via our fleet

1479
01:12:16.715 --> 01:12:19.515
of bots is being employed throughout the organization.

1480
01:12:20.605 --> 01:12:22.955
Julie talked to product simplification

1481
01:12:23.335 --> 01:12:25.115
and the growth in digital interactions

1482
01:12:25.115 --> 01:12:29.315
and how now more than 30% of claims are lodged digitally.

1483
01:12:30.365 --> 01:12:34.475
Jared described how he's applying gen ai, including Cassie,

1484
01:12:34.565 --> 01:12:35.795
which you saw in the showcase

1485
01:12:36.255 --> 01:12:38.995
and how he's tackling the volume of manual service queries,

1486
01:12:39.145 --> 01:12:42.075
seeking to have 50% of inquiries serviced digitally.

1487
01:12:43.055 --> 01:12:46.675
And Amanda mentioned the reduced time to close simple claims

1488
01:12:47.125 --> 01:12:49.795
where previously it took on average 28 days.

1489
01:12:50.375 --> 01:12:53.155
Now over 80% are closed into three days or less.

1490
01:12:54.455 --> 01:12:56.355
And these are just a few examples.

1491
01:12:57.065 --> 01:12:59.155
Over the last 12 months, we've worked hard

1492
01:12:59.215 --> 01:13:02.275
to entrench an organization wide focus on

1493
01:13:02.275 --> 01:13:03.635
productivity improvements.

1494
01:13:04.095 --> 01:13:06.355
We have over 200 claims

1495
01:13:06.455 --> 01:13:09.035
and cost reduction initiatives identified

1496
01:13:09.255 --> 01:13:13.155
and scheduled across IAG that are either being delivered now

1497
01:13:13.215 --> 01:13:15.555
or in our plans for the next couple of years.

1498
01:13:16.895 --> 01:13:18.395
We now have greater granularity

1499
01:13:18.395 --> 01:13:21.075
and strong rigor in tracking the financial outcomes,

1500
01:13:21.215 --> 01:13:23.915
giving confidence in delivering the benefits.

1501
01:13:25.365 --> 01:13:26.385
As a result of this,

1502
01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:29.185
we anticipate a reduction in our expense ratio.

1503
01:13:30.065 --> 01:13:34.025
Specifically the administration ratio on an X levy basis was

1504
01:13:34.025 --> 01:13:37.065
steady in FY 24 at 11.9%

1505
01:13:37.525 --> 01:13:41.305
and we expect this to reduce to under 11% in FY 27.

1506
01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:44.745
In terms of capitalized costs, they're likely

1507
01:13:44.805 --> 01:13:46.385
to continue in a similar range

1508
01:13:46.645 --> 01:13:49.745
as we transition activity from enterprise platform

1509
01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:51.465
to the commercial enablement program.

1510
01:13:52.685 --> 01:13:55.065
And finally, on FY 25 guidance,

1511
01:13:56.045 --> 01:13:59.425
we are reaffirming our GWP growth and insurance profit

1512
01:13:59.485 --> 01:14:00.625
and margin ranges.

1513
01:14:01.335 --> 01:14:04.065
Looking at the performance for the financial year to date,

1514
01:14:04.645 --> 01:14:06.545
perils have been favorable to allowance,

1515
01:14:06.885 --> 01:14:08.905
but we maintain the full year assumption

1516
01:14:09.205 --> 01:14:11.330
of 1280 $3 million for now.

1517
01:14:12.195 --> 01:14:15.125
Importantly, we are seeing inflation trends stable

1518
01:14:15.265 --> 01:14:19.685
or moderating while home inflation is broadly holding steady

1519
01:14:19.745 --> 01:14:23.165
in Australia, motor inflation has moderated to

1520
01:14:23.165 --> 01:14:26.485
around mid single digit while the experience in New Zealand

1521
01:14:26.665 --> 01:14:30.245
has materially subdued and the combination of inflation

1522
01:14:30.345 --> 01:14:32.965
and frequency across the book is running at a

1523
01:14:32.965 --> 01:14:34.085
low single digit level.

1524
01:14:35.595 --> 01:14:38.645
Premium rate trends across the board reflect these

1525
01:14:38.925 --> 01:14:40.645
movements, ensuring we stay disciplined

1526
01:14:41.105 --> 01:14:43.045
and maintain our margins in line

1527
01:14:43.075 --> 01:14:45.005
with our targets into FY 26.

1528
01:14:46.795 --> 01:14:49.245
Overall, we remain confident in the outlook

1529
01:14:49.425 --> 01:14:50.805
and being able to deliver our

1530
01:14:50.805 --> 01:14:54.205
through the cycle insurance margin and ROE targets.

1531
01:14:55.865 --> 01:14:58.845
On that note, let's head into q and a

1532
01:14:59.105 --> 01:15:02.485
and I'll ask my colleagues to join me here on the stage.

1533
01:15:05.955 --> 01:15:07.565
It's Andrew from Macquarie.

1534
01:15:07.825 --> 01:15:09.165
Uh, just a couple of questions.

1535
01:15:09.325 --> 01:15:10.645
I suppose I'll start with William.

1536
01:15:11.305 --> 01:15:15.365
Um, in particular on the expense ratio slide, um, point

1537
01:15:15.365 --> 01:15:18.205
to point, let's say that's a hundred basis points odd

1538
01:15:18.205 --> 01:15:22.165
improvement in the administration ratio X levies.

1539
01:15:22.625 --> 01:15:25.285
Um, but on the next slide, you've maintained you

1540
01:15:25.325 --> 01:15:27.085
through the cycle margin guidance.

1541
01:15:27.155 --> 01:15:29.565
Where's that a hundred basis points going? Thanks.

1542
01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:33.685
Yeah, that's right. So, um, we, we talked about,

1543
01:15:33.825 --> 01:15:35.325
um, so two things.

1544
01:15:35.385 --> 01:15:39.885
One is we talked about being able to invest more in, in, uh,

1545
01:15:40.175 --> 01:15:42.765
technology and transformation and customer,

1546
01:15:42.765 --> 01:15:46.165
but that's, that's taken account of in in that reduction.

1547
01:15:46.665 --> 01:15:49.445
But it's important for us to be competitive

1548
01:15:49.665 --> 01:15:52.125
to keep prices keen for customers.

1549
01:15:52.665 --> 01:15:55.725
Um, and of course, you know, staying competitive uh,

1550
01:15:55.725 --> 01:15:58.085
helps us to with our growth ambitions as well.

1551
01:15:58.425 --> 01:16:00.405
So we are absolutely committed to our

1552
01:16:00.595 --> 01:16:02.405
through the cycle margin levels.

1553
01:16:02.945 --> 01:16:04.685
Um, and, and that that's how that works.

1554
01:16:05.505 --> 01:16:08.125
And then a follow up question to that, how much of

1555
01:16:08.125 --> 01:16:11.685
that ratio improvement is actually coming from absolute cost

1556
01:16:11.865 --> 01:16:14.485
out compared to some form of mixed benefit

1557
01:16:14.545 --> 01:16:17.205
that's coming from the integration of RACQ,

1558
01:16:17.205 --> 01:16:19.805
which I imagine would have a mix towards a

1559
01:16:19.805 --> 01:16:20.845
lower ratio as well.

1560
01:16:20.985 --> 01:16:22.085
So how much is cost out

1561
01:16:22.085 --> 01:16:24.725
and how much is mixed from RACQ? Thanks,

1562
01:16:25.405 --> 01:16:29.525
I, all, all of all of that is from the, uh, the, the, the,

1563
01:16:29.525 --> 01:16:31.725
the sort of examples we described and,

1564
01:16:31.865 --> 01:16:35.085
and the, um, the cost out program, uh, that we're managing.

1565
01:16:35.085 --> 01:16:38.645
So that's not, um, that's not off the back of RACQ. Yeah,

1566
01:16:38.795 --> 01:16:40.285
None of it's, none of it's are.

1567
01:16:40.295 --> 01:16:41.295
Thank you.

1568
01:16:43.945 --> 01:16:46.445
Hi, uh, fre Kong from Bank of America.

1569
01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:48.805
Sorry, just to follow up on the previous question,

1570
01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:51.045
a hundred bips of saving, is that going

1571
01:16:51.045 --> 01:16:53.325
to be reinvested in a more competitive loss ratio?

1572
01:16:53.945 --> 01:16:56.325
Um, yes. Okay. Thank you.

1573
01:16:56.625 --> 01:17:00.005
Um, and then how do I think about, um, m and a versus,

1574
01:17:00.065 --> 01:17:01.565
or how should we think about m

1575
01:17:01.565 --> 01:17:03.285
and a versus capital return

1576
01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:05.285
to shareholders in terms of that stacking order?

1577
01:17:05.885 --> 01:17:07.405
'cause you said, I guess the hurdle is just

1578
01:17:07.445 --> 01:17:08.805
EPS secretion from year one.

1579
01:17:09.275 --> 01:17:11.325
Yeah, I mean, pretty much the way we, we tried

1580
01:17:11.325 --> 01:17:14.405
to set it out today around, you know, we're looking for,

1581
01:17:14.785 --> 01:17:16.405
you know, we wanna continue to grow the business

1582
01:17:17.425 --> 01:17:19.645
for various reasons, you know, sort of

1583
01:17:20.845 --> 01:17:23.725
regulatory technology costs, reinsurance costs.

1584
01:17:23.725 --> 01:17:27.125
It does seem like there's a number of small, um,

1585
01:17:27.845 --> 01:17:28.845
insurers in Australia

1586
01:17:28.985 --> 01:17:30.845
and New Zealand that, that are looking to,

1587
01:17:31.145 --> 01:17:32.165
to do something different.

1588
01:17:32.705 --> 01:17:35.365
Um, and so there are definitely opportunities available.

1589
01:17:36.105 --> 01:17:37.165
Um, and so

1590
01:17:37.165 --> 01:17:39.565
for us then it's the doesn't doesn't make sense

1591
01:17:39.565 --> 01:17:41.805
strategically, we've got a very strong bias

1592
01:17:41.805 --> 01:17:44.805
to retail insurers in, in this, in this discussion.

1593
01:17:45.665 --> 01:17:46.685
So then sort of that,

1594
01:17:46.825 --> 01:17:48.165
so the first point's really important

1595
01:17:48.165 --> 01:17:49.525
strategically, does it make sense?

1596
01:17:49.545 --> 01:17:51.245
How does it fit with what we've already got?

1597
01:17:51.705 --> 01:17:55.645
And then secondly, the financial discipline of, um,

1598
01:17:55.825 --> 01:17:57.485
you know, what does that, what does it do to the sort

1599
01:17:57.485 --> 01:18:01.245
of the, the financials of IAG, that EPS secretion, that sort

1600
01:18:01.245 --> 01:18:05.125
of 15% insurance margin, 14, 15% ROE,

1601
01:18:05.495 --> 01:18:08.245
we're gonna be very fixated on, on, on that as well.

1602
01:18:08.865 --> 01:18:10.725
And then, then it's, then it's a trade.

1603
01:18:10.845 --> 01:18:14.165
I mean, part of this is obviously also availability, um,

1604
01:18:14.165 --> 01:18:15.725
because opportunities just don't,

1605
01:18:15.875 --> 01:18:17.165
there's not that many opportunities.

1606
01:18:17.785 --> 01:18:19.445
Um, so we have to, every time, you know,

1607
01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:22.885
we think about something, we sort of go strategic lands

1608
01:18:23.305 --> 01:18:24.765
as well as that financial lens.

1609
01:18:24.785 --> 01:18:26.885
And then, you know, we make a call like we've just done

1610
01:18:26.885 --> 01:18:28.285
with RACQ.

1611
01:18:29.425 --> 01:18:31.805
So I'm, I'm guessing there's a lot of flexibility in

1612
01:18:31.805 --> 01:18:33.165
how you look at it throughout the year,

1613
01:18:33.785 --> 01:18:37.685
or do you sort of build up a treasure chest of, of capital

1614
01:18:37.785 --> 01:18:39.725
and then assess at the end of the year? Yeah,

1615
01:18:39.765 --> 01:18:42.405
I, I don't think of ourselves as, as sort

1616
01:18:42.405 --> 01:18:44.805
of running a, a chest like that.

1617
01:18:45.305 --> 01:18:48.365
Um, uh, you know, we, you know, we're gonna be disciplined

1618
01:18:48.365 --> 01:18:49.445
with our capital management.

1619
01:18:49.525 --> 01:18:51.565
I think we've, we've shown that, um,

1620
01:18:52.035 --> 01:18:54.485
that we have capital targets that we're going to,

1621
01:18:54.585 --> 01:18:58.885
to run the company to, I mean, I can't see this happening,

1622
01:18:58.945 --> 01:19:00.725
but, you know, for some unlikely event,

1623
01:19:00.725 --> 01:19:03.445
something large turned up that we, we needed to go

1624
01:19:03.445 --> 01:19:05.685
and talk to shareholders, um, we could.

1625
01:19:05.705 --> 01:19:07.565
So that doesn't trouble us that point.

1626
01:19:08.025 --> 01:19:10.045
Uh, and we're certainly not in the business of sort

1627
01:19:10.045 --> 01:19:11.645
of building up bigger

1628
01:19:11.645 --> 01:19:13.445
and bigger war chest for, for opportunities.

1629
01:19:13.455 --> 01:19:14.925
We're gonna be disciplined with how we,

1630
01:19:15.105 --> 01:19:17.365
how we think about this and, you know,

1631
01:19:17.365 --> 01:19:19.565
manage the capital in the targets that we've set out.

1632
01:19:20.265 --> 01:19:24.245
Thanks Ki

1633
01:19:24.265 --> 01:19:27.005
and should you UBS, um, just coming back

1634
01:19:27.005 --> 01:19:30.165
to the expense Im improvements across the group

1635
01:19:30.725 --> 01:19:33.085
divisionally, where do you still see the greatest

1636
01:19:33.315 --> 01:19:34.445
opportunity from here

1637
01:19:35.105 --> 01:19:36.485
In, in, in Divisionally?

1638
01:19:36.585 --> 01:19:38.645
Yep. Definitely within Jared's. Yep.

1639
01:19:38.945 --> 01:19:41.325
Um, I mean, I think Jared's talked about that.

1640
01:19:41.445 --> 01:19:43.605
I mean, he's, we've, we, we have a

1641
01:19:44.265 --> 01:19:46.805
under-invested commercial business for some time.

1642
01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:49.365
We've done, you know, as Jared stepped

1643
01:19:49.365 --> 01:19:51.005
through quite a lot of change already.

1644
01:19:51.505 --> 01:19:53.765
But there's, you know, there's, it's a, it's an opportunity.

1645
01:19:54.545 --> 01:19:55.805
Uh, this sits, sits in front

1646
01:19:55.805 --> 01:19:56.965
of us for the next couple of years.

1647
01:19:57.585 --> 01:19:59.565
And Jared, you touched on sort

1648
01:19:59.565 --> 01:20:01.645
of a softening commercial pricing backdrop,

1649
01:20:01.705 --> 01:20:05.005
and I think Amanda mentioned it in New Zealand as well.

1650
01:20:05.105 --> 01:20:08.205
Are you confident sort of the desire

1651
01:20:08.205 --> 01:20:11.405
to see margins increase from here, that there's enough cost

1652
01:20:11.915 --> 01:20:15.285
opportunity, even if we see pricing shift below inflation,

1653
01:20:15.355 --> 01:20:18.645
that, that you can deliver mar margin upside from here?

1654
01:20:19.275 --> 01:20:21.965
Yeah, well, we're certainly not seeing cost, uh, the,

1655
01:20:22.095 --> 01:20:24.725
sorry, the market rate drop below, uh,

1656
01:20:24.725 --> 01:20:26.925
inflation at the moment for our commercial business.

1657
01:20:27.585 --> 01:20:29.605
Um, so we're still getting rate increases

1658
01:20:29.605 --> 01:20:32.925
through the portfolio on average, across the portfolio as

1659
01:20:32.925 --> 01:20:33.965
of the end of Q1.

1660
01:20:34.425 --> 01:20:36.565
Um, so to me it's still a rational market,

1661
01:20:36.985 --> 01:20:39.045
but it's clear it's a market in transition

1662
01:20:39.425 --> 01:20:42.285
and we won't have another year of rate increases of,

1663
01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:45.325
as we've seen in the past, it'll happen in pockets.

1664
01:20:45.745 --> 01:20:47.845
Um, the investments we've made in our sort

1665
01:20:47.845 --> 01:20:51.125
of pricing sophistication, portfolio management,

1666
01:20:51.395 --> 01:20:53.965
they'll be tested through a soft market cycle.

1667
01:20:54.545 --> 01:20:56.205
So I guess the proof will be in the next

1668
01:20:56.205 --> 01:20:57.325
three years of delivering that.

1669
01:20:57.345 --> 01:21:00.565
Am I confident? Yes, I am confident in the investments we've

1670
01:21:00.565 --> 01:21:02.565
made and the capabilities we've built

1671
01:21:02.755 --> 01:21:04.365
that puts us in a strong position

1672
01:21:04.705 --> 01:21:06.165
to manage our way through the cycle.

1673
01:21:08.365 --> 01:21:09.285
Excellent. Do you wanna

1674
01:21:09.285 --> 01:21:10.405
make a comment, John, comment on,

1675
01:21:11.205 --> 01:21:12.525
I I just quickly, I mean,

1676
01:21:12.685 --> 01:21:15.045
I think we are seeing the market soften a little

1677
01:21:15.045 --> 01:21:16.445
faster than Australia.

1678
01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:20.085
Um, similar to Jared though, we're still seeing that,

1679
01:21:20.085 --> 01:21:23.245
you know, we, that the rates are holding, um,

1680
01:21:23.945 --> 01:21:26.325
and you know, we've, we've got similar opportunities.

1681
01:21:26.425 --> 01:21:28.005
We are looking at our pricing capability,

1682
01:21:28.055 --> 01:21:30.725
we're building out tactical solutions now, uh,

1683
01:21:30.725 --> 01:21:31.885
which will fill the gap

1684
01:21:31.885 --> 01:21:34.125
until we have a more strategic solution. Yep.

1685
01:21:34.705 --> 01:21:36.325
Thanks. And just a last question.

1686
01:21:36.405 --> 01:21:38.285
I think, William, you touched on sort

1687
01:21:38.285 --> 01:21:41.205
of motor inflation moderating, but home stable.

1688
01:21:42.015 --> 01:21:45.725
Julie, can you just maybe talk to what level of inflation

1689
01:21:46.385 --> 01:21:47.725
you're seeing across home

1690
01:21:47.785 --> 01:21:49.925
and sort of what, what is driving

1691
01:21:50.035 --> 01:21:51.965
that stickiness in in that book?

1692
01:21:52.595 --> 01:21:55.245
Sure. So in with home in Australia, we're still sort

1693
01:21:55.245 --> 01:21:58.285
of seeing that with low double digit inflation.

1694
01:21:58.475 --> 01:21:59.925
There's probably some signs of

1695
01:21:59.925 --> 01:22:01.965
that abating a little bit more than that.

1696
01:22:02.305 --> 01:22:04.245
Uh, but we're being quite cautious at the moment.

1697
01:22:04.785 --> 01:22:08.045
The drivers just continue to be, uh, the cost of trades,

1698
01:22:08.665 --> 01:22:11.045
the availability of some building materials,

1699
01:22:11.345 --> 01:22:12.685
and it's improving in pockets,

1700
01:22:12.825 --> 01:22:14.165
but there are some parts of the country

1701
01:22:14.165 --> 01:22:16.645
where those costs are still reasonably high.

1702
01:22:17.445 --> 01:22:19.205
I think over the next couple of months as we move

1703
01:22:19.205 --> 01:22:21.525
through the first part of, you know, the storm season,

1704
01:22:21.785 --> 01:22:24.245
we we'll feel more confident about the outlook on property.

1705
01:22:25.695 --> 01:22:30.285
Thank you Permission from JP Morgan.

1706
01:22:30.605 --> 01:22:31.645
A couple of questions if I can.

1707
01:22:31.865 --> 01:22:36.525
One, just on the slide on expenses, um, um, slide 56, um,

1708
01:22:36.875 --> 01:22:39.325
just in there you provided a breakdown of, um,

1709
01:22:39.345 --> 01:22:41.325
the different components of your compensation.

1710
01:22:41.385 --> 01:22:44.445
It looks like the grow component is increasing very

1711
01:22:44.445 --> 01:22:46.605
significantly starting from this year.

1712
01:22:46.725 --> 01:22:48.925
I just wanna be clear, is that the marketing budget

1713
01:22:49.105 --> 01:22:52.005
and are we saying that you're gonna be doubling

1714
01:22:52.005 --> 01:22:53.285
that within the next couple of years?

1715
01:22:53.425 --> 01:22:56.205
Is that, is that how I should be interpreting that slide?

1716
01:22:57.195 --> 01:22:59.205
It's, it's, it's more than just marketing.

1717
01:22:59.365 --> 01:23:00.605
I mean, it, there's, there's other,

1718
01:23:00.715 --> 01:23:03.725
there's other capabilities and digital investment

1719
01:23:03.865 --> 01:23:06.285
and so on that are, that are, um, uh,

1720
01:23:06.285 --> 01:23:07.525
that are part of that as well.

1721
01:23:07.865 --> 01:23:08.925
But yeah, it's important.

1722
01:23:09.005 --> 01:23:12.645
I mean, we, we, we, we talk about growth, um, it, it's,

1723
01:23:12.645 --> 01:23:14.565
it's a focus for us and,

1724
01:23:14.665 --> 01:23:17.645
and we look forward to, uh, you know, bringing down cost

1725
01:23:17.645 --> 01:23:18.525
to maintain, but, but

1726
01:23:18.525 --> 01:23:20.565
being able to invest a bit more in that. Yeah.

1727
01:23:21.295 --> 01:23:24.205
Maybe just carrying on on that theme, Nick, I think you,

1728
01:23:24.345 --> 01:23:26.685
you, you mentioned growth was a focus of yours

1729
01:23:27.525 --> 01:23:30.525
18 months ago, I think you mentioned it again at the last

1730
01:23:30.525 --> 01:23:31.765
result, just, just want,

1731
01:23:31.785 --> 01:23:34.765
but there wasn't really a lot today in terms of any numbers

1732
01:23:34.785 --> 01:23:36.005
around what you're targeting.

1733
01:23:36.005 --> 01:23:40.925
Could you just help us understand how you being, um,

1734
01:23:41.385 --> 01:23:43.765
you know, um, I suppose assessed on growth

1735
01:23:43.825 --> 01:23:47.365
and what your targets are, particularly in the personalized?

1736
01:23:47.795 --> 01:23:50.445
Yeah, I mean we still, I mean, just going back to

1737
01:23:50.445 --> 01:23:53.165
that expense comment just to, to see what we're trying

1738
01:23:53.165 --> 01:23:55.205
to do is have productivity efficiency

1739
01:23:55.305 --> 01:23:56.925
to fund what we're doing.

1740
01:23:57.265 --> 01:24:00.125
And so, you know, we we're sticking to the 15% margin.

1741
01:24:00.505 --> 01:24:03.285
We want to create ourselves more room to be able

1742
01:24:03.285 --> 01:24:06.125
to invest back into the business, to then to create,

1743
01:24:06.665 --> 01:24:09.285
you know, sort of that growth engine happening, um,

1744
01:24:09.285 --> 01:24:11.485
throughout the, particularly the retail businesses.

1745
01:24:11.785 --> 01:24:13.885
And when we put some targets out there around sort

1746
01:24:13.885 --> 01:24:15.565
of growing the business by a million customers,

1747
01:24:16.225 --> 01:24:17.765
um, you know, over a period of time.

1748
01:24:17.785 --> 01:24:19.565
And we've, we we're still very focused on that.

1749
01:24:19.805 --> 01:24:22.565
I mean, that's not, I mean that's, we're not adding RACQ to

1750
01:24:22.565 --> 01:24:24.645
that sort of did that in one one bite,

1751
01:24:24.705 --> 01:24:27.805
but that's in addition to RACQ.

1752
01:24:28.225 --> 01:24:29.765
So the sort of the, the timelines

1753
01:24:29.785 --> 01:24:31.485
and the way we'd sort of stepped that out.

1754
01:24:32.105 --> 01:24:33.485
Um, and yet, you know,

1755
01:24:33.485 --> 01:24:36.285
yet the last 18, 12 18 months was quite tough for us.

1756
01:24:36.345 --> 01:24:38.765
We had serious inflation that we had to,

1757
01:24:39.025 --> 01:24:40.205
to manage our business through.

1758
01:24:40.225 --> 01:24:43.485
We were doing quite a lot of pricing remediation as, as,

1759
01:24:43.505 --> 01:24:44.725
as everyone here is aware of.

1760
01:24:45.065 --> 01:24:47.605
And we've sort of got the business operating at, you know,

1761
01:24:47.605 --> 01:24:49.645
roughly the margins we wanna run the business at.

1762
01:24:50.225 --> 01:24:52.005
Um, and so I, you should expect

1763
01:24:52.005 --> 01:24:53.885
to see a little bit more customer growth come through

1764
01:24:54.505 --> 01:24:57.485
at December, and that's, that that sort

1765
01:24:57.485 --> 01:24:59.285
of plan over the next couple

1766
01:24:59.285 --> 01:25:03.365
of years is still the plan in relation to how we being, um,

1767
01:25:03.845 --> 01:25:04.965
rewarded call that.

1768
01:25:05.705 --> 01:25:07.125
Um, I mean that is an element.

1769
01:25:07.285 --> 01:25:10.925
I mean, we've got a heavy financial element in the way this

1770
01:25:10.925 --> 01:25:13.525
group is being rewarded sort of just on absolute earnings,

1771
01:25:13.715 --> 01:25:15.045
margins return on capital,

1772
01:25:15.705 --> 01:25:18.085
but growth is also an element of that.

1773
01:25:18.265 --> 01:25:20.365
And so we're not walking away from some

1774
01:25:20.365 --> 01:25:21.605
of those targets we set a year

1775
01:25:21.605 --> 01:25:23.445
or so ago, which a couple of years ago.

1776
01:25:24.025 --> 01:25:26.645
Um, and you know what I would like to, I think that

1777
01:25:27.695 --> 01:25:30.205
we've had a lot of resetting of the company

1778
01:25:30.705 --> 01:25:33.365
that's occurred over the last couple of years and,

1779
01:25:33.425 --> 01:25:37.925
and it's hard for us to explain what it's like

1780
01:25:37.925 --> 01:25:39.885
to re-platform, you know,

1781
01:25:39.885 --> 01:25:41.325
essentially two thirds of the company.

1782
01:25:41.745 --> 01:25:44.325
And that's, that, that's probably been a bigger exercise

1783
01:25:44.325 --> 01:25:45.365
than we originally thought.

1784
01:25:45.945 --> 01:25:47.805
Um, and you know, it takes a lot of our time

1785
01:25:47.985 --> 01:25:49.605
and that we've kind of got that running now.

1786
01:25:50.265 --> 01:25:53.965
And so maybe with hindsight, the amount of effort required

1787
01:25:53.965 --> 01:25:56.645
to make that happen, we probably slightly underestimated

1788
01:25:57.385 --> 01:25:59.045
the thing now is we've got it.

1789
01:25:59.225 --> 01:26:00.645
And so now you can tell

1790
01:26:00.645 --> 01:26:03.445
by our language the acquisition of RACQ.

1791
01:26:03.785 --> 01:26:06.165
So the confidence is up now about what that,

1792
01:26:06.165 --> 01:26:08.605
what opportunity that now presents us going forward.

1793
01:26:09.105 --> 01:26:10.245
So Sid, I'd like to think

1794
01:26:10.245 --> 01:26:13.005
that over the next 12, 18, 24 months,

1795
01:26:13.005 --> 01:26:14.165
you're gonna see customer numbers

1796
01:26:14.185 --> 01:26:17.725
and particularly in our retail businesses, you know, grow.

1797
01:26:18.835 --> 01:26:20.205
Just one final question.

1798
01:26:20.345 --> 01:26:24.125
Um, uh, when you announced the RACQ business, we didn't,

1799
01:26:24.125 --> 01:26:25.805
we didn't get a chance to ask many questions around it.

1800
01:26:25.855 --> 01:26:28.925
There were, we were lacking detail on, um, you know,

1801
01:26:28.925 --> 01:26:30.765
the profitability of exactly the bits that yeah,

1802
01:26:30.785 --> 01:26:33.605
you were buying the, the reason for the structure,

1803
01:26:33.615 --> 01:26:36.125
which was not a full, you know, um,

1804
01:26:36.275 --> 01:26:37.885
long term distribution arrangement

1805
01:26:37.985 --> 01:26:40.445
and, sorry, not a permanent distribution arrangement,

1806
01:26:40.475 --> 01:26:42.445
it's a 25 year arrangement.

1807
01:26:42.585 --> 01:26:46.005
Um, and just, um, you know, what happens at termination,

1808
01:26:46.105 --> 01:26:47.565
if you could just help Yeah, fill us,

1809
01:26:47.595 --> 01:26:49.085
fill us in on some of those details.

1810
01:26:49.355 --> 01:26:50.885
Yeah, sure. And I mean, part of that,

1811
01:26:50.885 --> 01:26:52.085
just sort about the way it was,

1812
01:26:52.245 --> 01:26:54.045
'cause we knew what we were doing today, so we put out a

1813
01:26:54.045 --> 01:26:55.565
pack and we did a few calls,

1814
01:26:55.585 --> 01:26:57.725
but we knew we were gonna be able to talk to everyone today.

1815
01:26:57.785 --> 01:27:00.765
So we, we welcome any, any questions on that too?

1816
01:27:01.625 --> 01:27:04.565
Um, sort of sort of breaking that down.

1817
01:27:04.625 --> 01:27:08.285
So the club exists as the club going forward so that,

1818
01:27:08.345 --> 01:27:10.365
so you know, we, we've done a partnership

1819
01:27:10.365 --> 01:27:11.805
with the insurance company

1820
01:27:11.905 --> 01:27:14.925
and the insurance proposition to RACQ, the brand

1821
01:27:15.665 --> 01:27:17.925
and the, the rest of the, the,

1822
01:27:18.105 --> 01:27:20.165
the member organization continues to be owned

1823
01:27:20.165 --> 01:27:21.365
by the member organizations.

1824
01:27:21.375 --> 01:27:23.965
We've just bought the insurance company within that.

1825
01:27:24.745 --> 01:27:27.685
Um, so if you think about us,

1826
01:27:27.685 --> 01:27:29.645
we've got three different arrangements like that now.

1827
01:27:29.645 --> 01:27:32.565
We've got the NMA, which was a demutualization

1828
01:27:32.565 --> 01:27:35.285
and separation of the insurance company

1829
01:27:35.505 --> 01:27:38.485
and the member organization, and we now share a brand,

1830
01:27:38.865 --> 01:27:39.965
and that's kind of unusual.

1831
01:27:40.905 --> 01:27:45.845
We have RACV, which was a DA transaction where we were,

1832
01:27:46.785 --> 01:27:51.725
uh, the mutual, it's pretty close to RACQ except the, um,

1833
01:27:52.125 --> 01:27:53.605
distribution deal is in perpetuity

1834
01:27:54.065 --> 01:27:57.205
and it's a 70 30 JV in perpetuity.

1835
01:27:58.125 --> 01:28:00.645
I mean that, that's probably a bit unusual now

1836
01:28:00.645 --> 01:28:02.685
to have a joint venture in perpetuity.

1837
01:28:03.245 --> 01:28:04.565
I would've thought what we've done

1838
01:28:04.795 --> 01:28:08.605
with RACQ is probably a more normal structure

1839
01:28:08.615 --> 01:28:12.125
where we've done, you know, there's integration costs,

1840
01:28:12.125 --> 01:28:13.765
there's set ups, there's all sorts

1841
01:28:13.765 --> 01:28:15.405
of things we sort of wanna be all in on this.

1842
01:28:15.405 --> 01:28:17.805
So we've done what we think is a pretty long term

1843
01:28:17.805 --> 01:28:19.245
transaction, 25 years.

1844
01:28:19.865 --> 01:28:20.885
So there's no one sort of

1845
01:28:20.885 --> 01:28:22.685
thinking, how are we gonna exit this?

1846
01:28:22.755 --> 01:28:24.205
It's all about this is forever.

1847
01:28:24.345 --> 01:28:25.605
That's how we're thinking about it.

1848
01:28:26.465 --> 01:28:28.285
Um, so that, so that, you know,

1849
01:28:28.285 --> 01:28:31.645
the perpetuity versus 25 years, I think practically

1850
01:28:32.565 --> 01:28:35.525
a 25 year would be more of a normal type arrangement.

1851
01:28:35.525 --> 01:28:36.925
Perpetuity is unusual.

1852
01:28:37.125 --> 01:28:39.405
I think, um, two,

1853
01:28:40.395 --> 01:28:42.645
it's not like RACV.

1854
01:28:42.705 --> 01:28:45.805
So yes, we ha we are, we announced that we bought 90%

1855
01:28:46.505 --> 01:28:50.325
on day one, but we have a fixed price option.

1856
01:28:50.385 --> 01:28:51.925
And that fixed price is the metrics

1857
01:28:51.955 --> 01:28:53.645
that we announced last week

1858
01:28:54.305 --> 01:28:58.645
to buy the remaining 10% at our call in two years time.

1859
01:28:59.145 --> 01:29:01.430
So we we're essentially gonna be a hundred hundred percent

1860
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:03.845
owner of that business after two years.

1861
01:29:04.625 --> 01:29:07.925
Um, and then the nature of the way it works

1862
01:29:09.065 --> 01:29:12.645
is actually very similar, um, until you come in to

1863
01:29:12.705 --> 01:29:15.885
how we operate with RACV, where the distribution is done

1864
01:29:15.885 --> 01:29:19.245
by the club, the product, the manufacturer, the pricing,

1865
01:29:19.425 --> 01:29:21.245
the claims management is all done by us.

1866
01:29:21.665 --> 01:29:24.125
And obviously we're partnering this wonderful brand,

1867
01:29:24.585 --> 01:29:25.925
you know, the strongest brand in that market

1868
01:29:26.475 --> 01:29:29.805
with the capability scale capital of IAG

1869
01:29:29.825 --> 01:29:32.805
and sort of partnering that up for the 1.7 million members

1870
01:29:32.905 --> 01:29:34.845
of, of Queensland.

1871
01:29:34.985 --> 01:29:38.925
So sort of it's, it feels like a, a pretty sort of, uh,

1872
01:29:38.925 --> 01:29:40.365
logical tie up in my mind

1873
01:29:40.365 --> 01:29:42.285
with a wonderful brand distribution and,

1874
01:29:42.285 --> 01:29:45.245
and sort of the capability from us, um, bringing

1875
01:29:45.245 --> 01:29:47.045
that together as an opportunity. But,

1876
01:29:47.465 --> 01:29:49.885
Oh yeah, I'll just make a a small additional comment.

1877
01:29:50.125 --> 01:29:52.885
I think just in the way we've structured the transaction,

1878
01:29:52.995 --> 01:29:55.725
it's really about delivering a great experience

1879
01:29:55.725 --> 01:29:57.645
to the members of RACQ.

1880
01:29:58.145 --> 01:30:01.245
So it's very important to RACQ that their membership kind

1881
01:30:01.245 --> 01:30:04.645
of embraces this opportunity and understands the change.

1882
01:30:04.825 --> 01:30:06.565
And similarly, it's really important for us

1883
01:30:07.035 --> 01:30:08.725
that those members are transitioned across

1884
01:30:08.725 --> 01:30:11.245
to this experience, um, you know,

1885
01:30:11.245 --> 01:30:12.445
as holistically as possible.

1886
01:30:12.865 --> 01:30:15.085
And so the structure is really around sustaining

1887
01:30:15.205 --> 01:30:16.365
that membership engagement.

1888
01:30:16.545 --> 01:30:19.445
And we've worked really closely with RACQ on that.

1889
01:30:19.445 --> 01:30:22.005
They're very proud of their membership base, you know,

1890
01:30:22.005 --> 01:30:23.485
they're loved in Queensland.

1891
01:30:23.985 --> 01:30:26.645
Um, and that's, we've really tried to, to work in, in a way

1892
01:30:26.645 --> 01:30:29.285
that's going to maximize the portfolio going forward.

1893
01:30:30.735 --> 01:30:32.685
Sorry, there are just two other parts of the question.

1894
01:30:32.685 --> 01:30:34.005
Just what happens at the end?

1895
01:30:34.385 --> 01:30:37.285
Uh, who keeps the customers, when the relationship ends?

1896
01:30:37.305 --> 01:30:39.805
Do, do they remain with the, uh, with you

1897
01:30:39.945 --> 01:30:42.805
or do they remain with the, I mean, do they go

1898
01:30:42.805 --> 01:30:44.805
with the RACQ business?

1899
01:30:44.945 --> 01:30:47.525
And the other question is just the profitability of home

1900
01:30:47.525 --> 01:30:49.245
and motor for RACQ.

1901
01:30:49.865 --> 01:30:51.605
How is it different? Profitable?

1902
01:30:52.155 --> 01:30:55.685
Yeah. At the, at the termination arrangements

1903
01:30:55.685 --> 01:30:57.645
after 25 years, it's a long way away.

1904
01:30:57.875 --> 01:30:59.845
Sure. Uh, maybe we'll just generalize.

1905
01:31:00.125 --> 01:31:01.245
I think we just generalize on that

1906
01:31:01.245 --> 01:31:02.565
because part of that is part

1907
01:31:02.565 --> 01:31:03.885
of the way we've negotiated the deal

1908
01:31:03.885 --> 01:31:05.885
and there's a number of other transactions on the

1909
01:31:05.885 --> 01:31:07.005
go at the moment as people aware of,

1910
01:31:07.605 --> 01:31:09.285
I mean, I'd just say we're comfortable at the end

1911
01:31:09.285 --> 01:31:12.165
of the term that, that we'll be in a reasonable position.

1912
01:31:12.225 --> 01:31:14.245
That's probably as far as I would go. I would go.

1913
01:31:14.885 --> 01:31:18.045
I would say though that this arrangement has been structured

1914
01:31:18.045 --> 01:31:20.885
in a way, um, whilst it's got a 25 year duration,

1915
01:31:20.915 --> 01:31:23.245
it's structured in a way that contemplates perpetuity.

1916
01:31:23.275 --> 01:31:24.965
Yeah. And our absolute intent is

1917
01:31:24.965 --> 01:31:26.485
that this is a long term transaction

1918
01:31:26.485 --> 01:31:28.285
that endures well beyond that time period.

1919
01:31:28.645 --> 01:31:30.085
I think that's how you should be thinking of it.

1920
01:31:30.205 --> 01:31:31.285
I mean, that's what I would expect.

1921
01:31:31.385 --> 01:31:34.205
And just on sit on profitability, um,

1922
01:31:34.205 --> 01:31:35.925
and the run rate of that business, um,

1923
01:31:36.065 --> 01:31:38.845
before any synergies is probably a combined ratio of sort

1924
01:31:38.845 --> 01:31:41.885
of mid to low nineties, um, across the Homer Motor book.

1925
01:31:41.945 --> 01:31:42.925
So it's, it's, it's quite

1926
01:31:42.925 --> 01:31:43.885
a lot of change that's happened there.

1927
01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:48.485
Um, I mean they had a CTP book that, that they,

1928
01:31:48.705 --> 01:31:51.285
and many others have had some real problems with.

1929
01:31:51.285 --> 01:31:53.325
They've, they've exited that out of their run rate

1930
01:31:53.905 --> 01:31:55.005
or exit outta their business.

1931
01:31:55.425 --> 01:31:57.645
Um, we know the cyclone pools come in

1932
01:31:57.645 --> 01:31:59.405
and so that sort of facilitated some

1933
01:31:59.405 --> 01:32:00.885
of their perils pricing and the like.

1934
01:32:01.585 --> 01:32:04.525
Um, and so we, we, we sort of think, we sort

1935
01:32:04.525 --> 01:32:06.885
of feel like we're buying that, that that business at about

1936
01:32:07.035 --> 01:32:08.085
that type of run rate.

1937
01:32:08.185 --> 01:32:09.565
And then what we're able to do,

1938
01:32:10.105 --> 01:32:11.885
and this is why it's, it's sort

1939
01:32:11.885 --> 01:32:13.205
of in my mind, a natural fit for us.

1940
01:32:13.665 --> 01:32:18.005
We get some, some pretty strong, um, reinsurance,

1941
01:32:18.545 --> 01:32:22.325
um, synergies that are sort of a big part of it, um,

1942
01:32:22.475 --> 01:32:23.685
over the first couple of years.

1943
01:32:24.425 --> 01:32:25.685
Um, and then, you know,

1944
01:32:25.685 --> 01:32:27.525
what we'll be then doing is integrating,

1945
01:32:27.665 --> 01:32:30.365
and that's why it's not part of the, the 11% at this point.

1946
01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:34.365
Um, you know, as then we'll be integrating onto the platform

1947
01:32:34.365 --> 01:32:36.245
we've built, bringing that business on.

1948
01:32:36.545 --> 01:32:37.965
So what we expect to do,

1949
01:32:38.415 --> 01:32:40.325
we're actually buying a licensed vehicle,

1950
01:32:40.795 --> 01:32:43.165
that licensed vehicle over the first, you know, we'll,

1951
01:32:43.175 --> 01:32:46.765
we'll, we'll aim to, to, to move that, remove that,

1952
01:32:46.765 --> 01:32:51.005
essentially put it into the main IAL entity of IAG, uh,

1953
01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:53.085
and then put it onto the, as part of that process,

1954
01:32:53.195 --> 01:32:54.925
sort go onto the enterprise platform.

1955
01:32:55.345 --> 01:32:58.165
And so it'll be integrated into the retail business.

1956
01:32:58.905 --> 01:33:00.405
One last thing, we talked about this

1957
01:33:00.405 --> 01:33:02.845
with members last Thursday when we were in Brisbane.

1958
01:33:03.455 --> 01:33:06.085
We're definitely going to reopen the discussion

1959
01:33:06.085 --> 01:33:10.885
around Queenstown, Queenstown, Queensland, CTP, um, that

1960
01:33:11.465 --> 01:33:15.605
we exited that so have they, the, the regulator.

1961
01:33:15.605 --> 01:33:17.805
And we've said we would like to be part of that,

1962
01:33:18.225 --> 01:33:20.845
but we need scheme reform that she spoke to the,

1963
01:33:21.065 --> 01:33:22.805
to the regulator on Thursday and,

1964
01:33:23.265 --> 01:33:24.685
and said that to them directly.

1965
01:33:25.345 --> 01:33:27.485
And so, you know, that's sort of a, a work in progress

1966
01:33:27.485 --> 01:33:30.525
for us because we like the idea with some reform happening

1967
01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:32.925
for us to reenter that market that'll be good

1968
01:33:32.925 --> 01:33:34.405
for RACQ members.

1969
01:33:34.685 --> 01:33:37.565
'cause we would reenter it under the RACQ brand

1970
01:33:38.115 --> 01:33:39.445
with us being the manufacturer.

1971
01:33:39.545 --> 01:33:42.325
So that's, so that's, we haven't factored that in,

1972
01:33:42.345 --> 01:33:44.725
but that's sort of in, in our, in our minds an opportunity.

1973
01:33:45.505 --> 01:33:47.685
It feels like the regulator is gonna want to have a scheme

1974
01:33:47.715 --> 01:33:49.685
with, with more market participants

1975
01:33:49.685 --> 01:33:51.445
that is than what's currently there.

1976
01:33:51.905 --> 01:33:53.645
And so, I mean, I, I think that's likely

1977
01:33:53.665 --> 01:33:55.165
to happen over the next 12, eight months.

1978
01:34:00.025 --> 01:34:01.685
Hi guys. Thanks for taking out questions.

1979
01:34:01.945 --> 01:34:04.845
Um, just a first one, in terms of just the,

1980
01:34:05.225 --> 01:34:08.725
the rate increases in the RACQ portfolio,

1981
01:34:09.225 --> 01:34:10.485
can you maybe talk a bit about how

1982
01:34:10.485 --> 01:34:13.165
that's been trending over time and expectations from here?

1983
01:34:13.585 --> 01:34:16.045
And then also just the retention, how that's been tracked?

1984
01:34:16.045 --> 01:34:17.445
I know you've given us one data point there,

1985
01:34:17.865 --> 01:34:19.645
but keen to understand how that's been trending.

1986
01:34:20.435 --> 01:34:21.805
Yeah, I mean, you mate, so it's,

1987
01:34:21.915 --> 01:34:25.005
it's a extremely well loved brand in Queensland

1988
01:34:25.225 --> 01:34:28.685
and so it has many, many characteristics similar to

1989
01:34:28.685 --> 01:34:29.765
what we see with NRMA.

1990
01:34:30.225 --> 01:34:32.085
So that's a high level, but Julie,

1991
01:34:32.795 --> 01:34:36.045
Yeah, I mean I think the, the RACQ book,

1992
01:34:36.115 --> 01:34:38.245
like every book in Australia of home

1993
01:34:38.265 --> 01:34:42.085
and motor has gone through transformation in terms of price.

1994
01:34:42.905 --> 01:34:46.045
Um, what I, what we've looked at over the last period

1995
01:34:46.205 --> 01:34:48.325
of time has been the work they've been doing similar

1996
01:34:48.345 --> 01:34:50.565
to us in supply chain, particularly around motor.

1997
01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:52.845
And they've done some great work there in terms

1998
01:34:52.845 --> 01:34:54.885
of managing inflationary costs.

1999
01:34:55.665 --> 01:34:57.805
Um, in terms of home, there's similar experiences

2000
01:34:57.805 --> 01:34:58.925
that we're all experiencing.

2001
01:34:58.925 --> 01:35:00.685
There's not specific company issues,

2002
01:35:00.685 --> 01:35:02.445
they're broad industry-wide issues.

2003
01:35:03.145 --> 01:35:05.925
Um, and so what we are seeing is, you know, pricing kind

2004
01:35:05.925 --> 01:35:08.125
of following those trends, um,

2005
01:35:08.225 --> 01:35:11.125
and moving, you know, abating as well with those trends.

2006
01:35:11.545 --> 01:35:14.525
As Nick said, we are confident in the delivery of that sort

2007
01:35:14.525 --> 01:35:17.965
of, you know, low nineties, um, combined over time.

2008
01:35:18.785 --> 01:35:20.845
And, um, you know, that that's part

2009
01:35:20.845 --> 01:35:21.885
of the reason we're bringing a home

2010
01:35:21.885 --> 01:35:24.085
and motor book into a home and motor book.

2011
01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:26.005
So we feel we are pretty confident about that.

2012
01:35:26.585 --> 01:35:28.325
So, so what you're saying there is you, you're comfortable

2013
01:35:28.325 --> 01:35:29.965
with the level of pricing Yeah.

2014
01:35:29.965 --> 01:35:32.325
Price adequacy and you're comfortable, you, so there's no,

2015
01:35:32.325 --> 01:35:34.605
there's not gonna be an acceleration in pricing under

2016
01:35:34.605 --> 01:35:35.845
your stewardship

2017
01:35:36.305 --> 01:35:37.305
At the moment. We're pretty comfortable

2018
01:35:37.305 --> 01:35:39.245
in what we've seen in terms

2019
01:35:39.245 --> 01:35:41.125
of the price levels and so on.

2020
01:35:41.145 --> 01:35:43.525
And I think the opportunities, as Nick said, are in

2021
01:35:43.525 --> 01:35:46.525
how we manage the portfolio around technology, capital

2022
01:35:46.745 --> 01:35:50.045
and so on as being where we can bring, um, a different way

2023
01:35:50.045 --> 01:35:51.565
of thinking about a book that's gonna help the

2024
01:35:51.765 --> 01:35:53.085
customer and help the member.

2025
01:35:54.275 --> 01:35:55.285
Okay. No, that makes sense.

2026
01:35:55.345 --> 01:35:58.165
Um, and then maybe just on the sort of 21 basis points

2027
01:35:58.165 --> 01:36:02.005
of capital impact, what exactly does that assume in terms

2028
01:36:02.005 --> 01:36:05.245
of reinsurance structures on the RACQ portfolio?

2029
01:36:05.785 --> 01:36:07.685
Um, so yeah, just interested in the breakup there between

2030
01:36:08.075 --> 01:36:09.005
what you're paying and the

2031
01:36:09.005 --> 01:36:10.125
capital benefit that you've assumed.

2032
01:36:11.115 --> 01:36:15.725
Yeah, William. Yeah, I don't, I don't think I want

2033
01:36:15.725 --> 01:36:18.525
to go into into great specifics there,

2034
01:36:18.585 --> 01:36:21.605
but, um, you know, we, we, we, we do expect that

2035
01:36:21.715 --> 01:36:25.405
that over time, the, the, the, the reinsurance, uh, the type

2036
01:36:25.405 --> 01:36:27.645
of reinsurance structures that we have for the group will be

2037
01:36:28.145 --> 01:36:32.525
of benefit for RACQ, um, you know, relative

2038
01:36:32.545 --> 01:36:33.805
to, to what they have now.

2039
01:36:34.865 --> 01:36:35.965
And so, sorry, so what's

2040
01:36:35.965 --> 01:36:37.125
exactly, what, what did they have now?

2041
01:36:37.125 --> 01:36:39.245
Is it just a 35% quarter share? Is that

2042
01:36:40.035 --> 01:36:41.965
Yeah, and, and the, and the CAP program,

2043
01:36:42.625 --> 01:36:44.125
And I think it's really important, you know,

2044
01:36:44.125 --> 01:36:46.365
this is a business that's continuing to operate.

2045
01:36:46.855 --> 01:36:49.645
We've gotta go through some approval processes.

2046
01:36:50.145 --> 01:36:52.045
And so in terms of their specifics,

2047
01:36:52.235 --> 01:36:54.365
obviously they're buying standalone reinsurance

2048
01:36:54.385 --> 01:36:57.085
for Queensland and that can be really difficult at times.

2049
01:36:57.225 --> 01:36:59.005
So in terms of being able to absorb

2050
01:36:59.005 --> 01:37:01.365
that into a much bigger portfolio, that's

2051
01:37:01.365 --> 01:37:02.645
where our benefits come from.

2052
01:37:02.985 --> 01:37:06.205
And, and that's been our playbook when we've been,

2053
01:37:06.305 --> 01:37:08.885
you know, taken on other portfolios in the past that,

2054
01:37:08.885 --> 01:37:11.405
that you should assume that a generalization

2055
01:37:11.405 --> 01:37:13.965
that they would then fit within the overall structure.

2056
01:37:14.665 --> 01:37:18.285
Um, the, the individual license entity, we can look through

2057
01:37:18.285 --> 01:37:19.685
that for the purpose of reinsurance.

2058
01:37:19.745 --> 01:37:21.485
So we don't, we don't need to have done

2059
01:37:22.035 --> 01:37:26.565
that integration onto our platform, moved into IAL to to,

2060
01:37:26.835 --> 01:37:29.165
because we already buy reinsurance

2061
01:37:29.165 --> 01:37:30.925
that covers multiple license entities

2062
01:37:30.925 --> 01:37:32.045
across Australia and New Zealand.

2063
01:37:32.145 --> 01:37:36.085
So we can effectively access that opportunity straight away.

2064
01:37:36.185 --> 01:37:38.205
And, and then just the last question for me in terms

2065
01:37:38.225 --> 01:37:42.485
of the, the comment around investing in, in loss ratios, uh,

2066
01:37:42.485 --> 01:37:44.685
just for growth, um, which is offsetting some

2067
01:37:44.685 --> 01:37:47.205
of the expense benefits, um, correct me if I'm wrong there,

2068
01:37:47.305 --> 01:37:48.765
but just to understand, where,

2069
01:37:48.815 --> 01:37:51.085
where are you seeing potential pressure

2070
01:37:51.085 --> 01:37:54.365
where rates may start to be running below inflation?

2071
01:37:54.365 --> 01:37:55.485
Which classes a business,

2072
01:37:55.485 --> 01:37:58.565
where is it getting more competitive, uh, that you may need

2073
01:37:58.565 --> 01:38:00.405
to be competing on price to, to grow?

2074
01:38:02.525 --> 01:38:05.485
I mean, maybe it's a comment for, for each of the, each

2075
01:38:05.485 --> 01:38:07.005
of the businesses to, to,

2076
01:38:07.105 --> 01:38:08.805
to maybe Julie, then Jared and Amanda.

2077
01:38:09.795 --> 01:38:13.365
Sure. So inflation is still tracking.

2078
01:38:14.385 --> 01:38:18.085
Um, we're not in a deflationary environment yet.

2079
01:38:18.285 --> 01:38:20.965
I would say. I think we've talked a lot about the cost

2080
01:38:20.965 --> 01:38:22.925
of motor repairs becoming more expensive

2081
01:38:23.035 --> 01:38:25.405
with different types of parts, different types

2082
01:38:25.405 --> 01:38:27.485
of technology in the vehicles and so on.

2083
01:38:28.025 --> 01:38:30.685
Um, so, so we're still seeing inflation in the book.

2084
01:38:30.795 --> 01:38:33.285
It's just nowhere near the levels that it was in the past.

2085
01:38:34.195 --> 01:38:36.965
There's always competition in this market.

2086
01:38:37.235 --> 01:38:39.205
It's particularly prevalent in motor.

2087
01:38:40.105 --> 01:38:41.365
Um, and that's why we've done

2088
01:38:41.425 --> 01:38:44.805
so much work rearchitecting all of our supply chain,

2089
01:38:45.145 --> 01:38:46.805
you know, looking at our claims processes

2090
01:38:46.805 --> 01:38:49.845
and really making sure that we're as efficient as we can be.

2091
01:38:50.145 --> 01:38:52.605
So a lot of our digital investments go into that space

2092
01:38:52.605 --> 01:38:55.005
that allow us to, to bring claims costs down

2093
01:38:55.005 --> 01:38:56.525
so we can pass that to customer.

2094
01:38:57.225 --> 01:39:00.885
Um, we see lots of discounting on, on first year of business

2095
01:39:01.505 --> 01:39:03.125
and, you know, that does concern us.

2096
01:39:03.125 --> 01:39:04.845
That's not something that IAG does.

2097
01:39:05.505 --> 01:39:07.005
Um, and when, but,

2098
01:39:07.025 --> 01:39:09.125
but once that goes through a 12 month cycle,

2099
01:39:09.625 --> 01:39:11.245
we see those customers return

2100
01:39:11.785 --> 01:39:13.885
as their second year premium hits them.

2101
01:39:14.305 --> 01:39:16.445
And so, you know, we, we kind of just need to make, we,

2102
01:39:16.445 --> 01:39:18.485
we're trying to make sure that we ride the cycles through,

2103
01:39:18.795 --> 01:39:21.885
that we deliver as an efficient product as we possibly can.

2104
01:39:22.545 --> 01:39:23.765
Um, and we are comfortable

2105
01:39:23.765 --> 01:39:25.365
that we're set up to do that in the right way.

2106
01:39:27.225 --> 01:39:30.485
And just on the intermediated business, um, we don't look,

2107
01:39:30.545 --> 01:39:33.245
we don't look to that for the, um, for the growth

2108
01:39:33.305 --> 01:39:34.605
to drive growth in our business.

2109
01:39:34.795 --> 01:39:37.285
Ours will be about where we see there's margin opportunity

2110
01:39:37.705 --> 01:39:39.805
and we'll write the business at the price that delivers

2111
01:39:39.805 --> 01:39:41.765
that margin broker personal lines.

2112
01:39:42.065 --> 01:39:44.645
Um, we, we look to manage that and,

2113
01:39:44.705 --> 01:39:46.325
and price that to margin.

2114
01:39:46.985 --> 01:39:50.285
Um, and so we are, we are looking, we work closely

2115
01:39:50.315 --> 01:39:52.165
with Julie and understanding what the inflation

2116
01:39:52.785 --> 01:39:54.125
claims inflation looks like,

2117
01:39:54.125 --> 01:39:56.285
and we ensure that we we're getting adequate price

2118
01:39:56.745 --> 01:39:58.365
and deliver a fair price to market.

2119
01:40:00.035 --> 01:40:01.805
Yeah, and, and I think in New Zealand, in the,

2120
01:40:02.065 --> 01:40:03.885
our personal lines market, we're certainly not,

2121
01:40:04.135 --> 01:40:07.645
we're seeing home, um, slightly lower than,

2122
01:40:08.195 --> 01:40:09.965
than Australia in terms of inflation rates,

2123
01:40:10.345 --> 01:40:11.645
and that's driven by a few things.

2124
01:40:11.715 --> 01:40:13.245
It's not the sort of public spending

2125
01:40:13.275 --> 01:40:15.125
that we are seeing in Australia.

2126
01:40:15.265 --> 01:40:16.845
So the availability of trades

2127
01:40:16.865 --> 01:40:19.485
and, um, supply is actually okay.

2128
01:40:20.145 --> 01:40:24.165
Um, I, I, I would expect that we would sort of keep ahead

2129
01:40:24.165 --> 01:40:27.925
of inflation, um, over the next, um, year

2130
01:40:28.515 --> 01:40:33.485
with very low single digit increases across both portfolios.

2131
01:40:33.695 --> 01:40:37.925
Where it's most, um, obvious is probably the motor space.

2132
01:40:37.995 --> 01:40:39.085
It's similar to Julie.

2133
01:40:39.425 --> 01:40:42.045
And we have, you know, all the work that we're doing

2134
01:40:42.045 --> 01:40:43.285
around supply chain and ensuring

2135
01:40:43.285 --> 01:40:44.925
that we're keeping those repair costs low,

2136
01:40:45.305 --> 01:40:46.965
so we can pass that back to the customer.

2137
01:40:49.705 --> 01:40:51.045
Hi there, Simon from Jefferies.

2138
01:40:51.065 --> 01:40:52.365
Um, just a real quick question.

2139
01:40:52.365 --> 01:40:53.765
On the $50 million of savings

2140
01:40:53.765 --> 01:40:57.605
around the reinsurance program on the RACQ, does that assume

2141
01:40:57.605 --> 01:40:59.885
that it'll be included in your long-term

2142
01:41:00.625 --> 01:41:02.325
perils volatility program?

2143
01:41:03.185 --> 01:41:04.565
Um, do you have to get permission,

2144
01:41:04.565 --> 01:41:06.005
obviously from Berkshire Hathaway

2145
01:41:06.005 --> 01:41:07.645
and your other partners, whether you've already done so,

2146
01:41:08.345 --> 01:41:10.885
and what addition would that cost just for

2147
01:41:10.885 --> 01:41:13.965
that particular part of the portfolio, if you had any sort

2148
01:41:13.965 --> 01:41:15.005
of comments to make around that?

2149
01:41:16.195 --> 01:41:19.325
Yeah, well, I mean we, we've, uh, as you can imagine, um,

2150
01:41:19.545 --> 01:41:21.485
you know, we, we, we've been speaking to our

2151
01:41:22.005 --> 01:41:23.485
reinsurance partners at least had, had,

2152
01:41:23.545 --> 01:41:24.765
had initial conversations.

2153
01:41:25.385 --> 01:41:26.525
Um, and, and,

2154
01:41:26.525 --> 01:41:29.485
and one way to think about it is, is, um, you know,

2155
01:41:29.485 --> 01:41:30.565
if you look at the,

2156
01:41:30.865 --> 01:41:34.525
the geographic geographic diversification that IAG has

2157
01:41:35.105 --> 01:41:37.245
across different regions of Australia

2158
01:41:37.665 --> 01:41:42.525
and New Zealand, um, we were underweight in Queensland

2159
01:41:43.025 --> 01:41:44.725
and this sort of fills out that part.

2160
01:41:44.785 --> 01:41:46.765
So, so there's, you can see there's a natural,

2161
01:41:47.435 --> 01:41:50.085
there's a natural benefit to us relative

2162
01:41:50.085 --> 01:41:53.525
to Queensland standalone, uh, for bringing this in.

2163
01:41:53.785 --> 01:41:55.125
Um, but I, I don't think I want

2164
01:41:55.125 --> 01:41:56.885
to go much further than that just for now.

2165
01:41:57.605 --> 01:42:01.005
I, I think we should say that we would have a similar, um,

2166
01:42:01.775 --> 01:42:03.845
apply a similar reinsurance philosophy

2167
01:42:03.845 --> 01:42:06.285
and strategy to this book as we do to our whole portfolio,

2168
01:42:06.865 --> 01:42:10.045
and we'll work really closely with our reinsurance partners

2169
01:42:10.545 --> 01:42:13.045
as we progress over the next sort of six to 12 months

2170
01:42:13.465 --> 01:42:15.525
to find the best structures that help us deliver that.

2171
01:42:16.025 --> 01:42:17.445
Um, it's also really important

2172
01:42:17.515 --> 01:42:20.925
that we respect the reinsurance partners of RACQ.

2173
01:42:21.075 --> 01:42:22.525
They're very similar to ours.

2174
01:42:22.745 --> 01:42:25.085
Um, but you know, they've done a lot of work with

2175
01:42:25.085 --> 01:42:26.525
that business for a long period of time

2176
01:42:26.545 --> 01:42:28.765
and they, you know, they're still working there.

2177
01:42:28.865 --> 01:42:29.865
So

2178
01:42:33.975 --> 01:42:34.975
Thank, thank you. Um,

2179
01:42:34.975 --> 01:42:36.765
to Anthony, who at CLSA, um,

2180
01:42:37.225 --> 01:42:39.885
can I ask the first question just on the RACQ transaction?

2181
01:42:40.025 --> 01:42:44.605
Um, you talked about the transaction aligning with your 14,

2182
01:42:44.605 --> 01:42:45.885
15% insurance margin.

2183
01:42:46.705 --> 01:42:49.685
Can you talk about how far away the business is

2184
01:42:49.685 --> 01:42:50.765
from that margin at the moment?

2185
01:42:51.325 --> 01:42:53.045
I mean, are we talking sort of next 12 months

2186
01:42:53.045 --> 01:42:55.885
or are we talking sort of three, five years or? Oh,

2187
01:42:55.905 --> 01:42:56.905
No, no. I mean, we've,

2188
01:42:56.905 --> 01:42:58.085
I mean, I'm, we, you know,

2189
01:42:58.085 --> 01:43:00.725
the run rate we're saying that we're targeting IAG

2190
01:43:01.425 --> 01:43:05.285
to deliver about a 15% margin, 14 to 15% ROE.

2191
01:43:05.285 --> 01:43:08.525
That's our sort of financial profile.

2192
01:43:09.285 --> 01:43:12.005
I mean, bring, and then we've said this, this transaction,

2193
01:43:12.825 --> 01:43:16.965
um, will be EPSA created day one, um,

2194
01:43:17.105 --> 01:43:20.445
to IAG, and I would expect that we'll be operating at

2195
01:43:20.445 --> 01:43:25.085
that 15% insurance margin, 14 to 15% ROE,

2196
01:43:25.385 --> 01:43:26.925
you know, in the, in the first year.

2197
01:43:27.745 --> 01:43:29.565
Um, partly

2198
01:43:29.565 --> 01:43:32.245
because bringing sort of the, sort of the,

2199
01:43:32.245 --> 01:43:35.245
what William's been talking about that, that, yes,

2200
01:43:35.245 --> 01:43:36.365
we've got an, we're sort of almost,

2201
01:43:36.365 --> 01:43:37.925
we've got a few different layers here.

2202
01:43:37.925 --> 01:43:42.445
We've got day one just start, just to be clear,

2203
01:43:42.565 --> 01:43:44.885
everyone at one January and our renewals, our,

2204
01:43:45.065 --> 01:43:47.045
our reinsurance, none of this impacts it.

2205
01:43:47.105 --> 01:43:49.685
So sort of business as usual at IAG well,

2206
01:43:49.685 --> 01:43:52.285
obviously we're contemplating what this could look like,

2207
01:43:52.705 --> 01:43:54.725
but we we're sort of doing our own thing.

2208
01:43:55.755 --> 01:43:57.525
It's almost three, three waves here.

2209
01:43:58.025 --> 01:44:01.125
The sort of the, the transaction is approved, we hope,

2210
01:44:01.125 --> 01:44:02.885
and toward the middle of the year,

2211
01:44:03.305 --> 01:44:06.365
and then we'll be able to sort of look at reinsurance

2212
01:44:06.545 --> 01:44:07.965
and obviously contemplate it before,

2213
01:44:07.965 --> 01:44:10.525
but look at reinsurance pretty quickly as part of that,

2214
01:44:11.305 --> 01:44:12.645
the sort of supply chain

2215
01:44:12.865 --> 01:44:17.165
and how we can support this business with the supply chain

2216
01:44:17.505 --> 01:44:18.805
and arrangements that we have.

2217
01:44:19.225 --> 01:44:21.045
And then there's sort of the, the integration

2218
01:44:22.025 --> 01:44:25.085
and sort of actually bringing onto our platform, uh,

2219
01:44:25.085 --> 01:44:26.245
which does take a bit longer.

2220
01:44:26.545 --> 01:44:28.765
And that's sort of, we're sort of saying that as more sort

2221
01:44:28.765 --> 01:44:31.885
of in the, of a couple of years that we think it'll take us

2222
01:44:31.885 --> 01:44:34.165
by the time we, and that as part of that process,

2223
01:44:34.495 --> 01:44:36.765
we'll need some sort of court approval probably

2224
01:44:36.765 --> 01:44:40.045
where we'll migrate the policies from the current entity

2225
01:44:40.105 --> 01:44:41.205
to, to IAL.

2226
01:44:41.205 --> 01:44:44.525
And that's, that's, that's something that's, that's, um,

2227
01:44:45.125 --> 01:44:46.645
happened many times in this market before.

2228
01:44:46.995 --> 01:44:48.445
It's all within the IAG world.

2229
01:44:48.985 --> 01:44:51.605
Um, so therefore, in relation to

2230
01:44:52.355 --> 01:44:55.445
what you should see in the first year of financials, as,

2231
01:44:55.465 --> 01:44:59.445
you know, with the sort of the 15% margin, 14 to 15%, um,

2232
01:45:00.665 --> 01:45:02.005
uh, ROE and,

2233
01:45:02.105 --> 01:45:06.205
and you know, an uplift, assuming we settle on one July 25,

2234
01:45:06.345 --> 01:45:08.605
uh, an uplift in our premium pool of 1.3,

2235
01:45:08.665 --> 01:45:10.805
1.4 billion from this business, that's,

2236
01:45:10.805 --> 01:45:11.965
that's what we should be expecting.

2237
01:45:13.585 --> 01:45:17.045
Um, thanks. Just a second question, uh, just coming back

2238
01:45:17.045 --> 01:45:20.325
to I think one of Julie's slides talking about, uh,

2239
01:45:20.685 --> 01:45:23.645
customer retention, um, over 90%

2240
01:45:24.225 --> 01:45:25.485
and you have, you know, one

2241
01:45:25.485 --> 01:45:26.965
of your targets getting to a hundred percent.

2242
01:45:27.285 --> 01:45:29.645
I mean, just wondering if you can elaborate on that.

2243
01:45:29.645 --> 01:45:32.245
You know, is it actually a, a, a realistic target

2244
01:45:32.275 --> 01:45:33.365
that you're actually aiming for?

2245
01:45:33.365 --> 01:45:34.965
Is it kind of an aspirational target?

2246
01:45:35.545 --> 01:45:37.685
How, how do you, you know, what are you investing in?

2247
01:45:37.705 --> 01:45:40.085
How do the initiatives, how do you get there? Sure.

2248
01:45:40.265 --> 01:45:42.845
So I think we, we've sort of called out a desire

2249
01:45:42.845 --> 01:45:45.605
that customers that, that sort of slide says customers

2250
01:45:45.605 --> 01:45:48.005
that have been with us for longer than 10 years.

2251
01:45:48.865 --> 01:45:49.925
Um, our aim

2252
01:45:50.185 --> 01:45:52.165
and it is aspirational, is

2253
01:45:52.165 --> 01:45:54.205
to retain a hundred percent of those customers.

2254
01:45:54.945 --> 01:45:57.365
Um, and we might not quite get there.

2255
01:45:57.945 --> 01:46:01.245
Um, but, but in terms of the message to our teams,

2256
01:46:01.815 --> 01:46:04.045
these are our most valuable customer group.

2257
01:46:04.045 --> 01:46:05.805
They're our most trusted customer group.

2258
01:46:05.865 --> 01:46:06.965
We know the most about them.

2259
01:46:07.745 --> 01:46:09.485
And I would like our teams

2260
01:46:09.545 --> 01:46:12.085
to just be relentlessly focused on making sure

2261
01:46:12.515 --> 01:46:15.325
that we are continuing to deliver to those customers

2262
01:46:15.325 --> 01:46:16.805
that have given us their trust for that long.

2263
01:46:17.345 --> 01:46:19.205
Um, so it's a little bit aspirational,

2264
01:46:19.785 --> 01:46:22.285
but we're focused on better service, better digital,

2265
01:46:22.685 --> 01:46:25.565
bringing forward and helping customers understand our

2266
01:46:25.845 --> 01:46:29.405
discounts our products by designing more services that,

2267
01:46:29.405 --> 01:46:30.405
that meet their needs

2268
01:46:30.825 --> 01:46:32.925
and really elevating the personal contact,

2269
01:46:33.335 --> 01:46:35.805
which I think has been a little bit missing in our business.

2270
01:46:36.265 --> 01:46:38.005
So that engagement with those,

2271
01:46:38.055 --> 01:46:40.925
those customers longer than 10 years of tenure, um,

2272
01:46:41.105 --> 01:46:42.765
you know, connecting with them,

2273
01:46:43.145 --> 01:46:44.885
making sure we understand their needs

2274
01:46:45.265 --> 01:46:46.925
and really driving that retention up

2275
01:46:46.925 --> 01:46:48.845
because that's where we create an incredible

2276
01:46:48.925 --> 01:46:50.245
Amount of value for our business.

2277
01:46:52.135 --> 01:46:53.135
Thank you.

2278
01:46:53.945 --> 01:46:55.205
Hi, mark Tomlin, hunter Green.

2279
01:46:55.425 --> 01:46:56.645
Uh, three questions if I may.

2280
01:46:56.695 --> 01:46:58.965
First of all, I'd like to direct to William, um,

2281
01:46:59.065 --> 01:47:03.525
and your last slide on guidance reaffirm, um, there seems

2282
01:47:03.525 --> 01:47:05.485
to be a slight change in wording there, discussing

2283
01:47:05.485 --> 01:47:08.085
that new business levels are challenging.

2284
01:47:08.105 --> 01:47:09.765
Is that due to tough conditions in New Zealand

2285
01:47:09.865 --> 01:47:10.925
or competition in Australia?

2286
01:47:12.875 --> 01:47:15.845
Yeah, so, so I think we talked about, um, what's happening

2287
01:47:15.955 --> 01:47:17.525
with, uh, with inflation

2288
01:47:17.625 --> 01:47:20.605
and obviously we're looking to rate, um, uh, to, to,

2289
01:47:20.705 --> 01:47:21.885
to cover that at least.

2290
01:47:21.945 --> 01:47:24.805
And, and so, um, uh, you know, we,

2291
01:47:24.805 --> 01:47:26.565
we we're confident in our margin.

2292
01:47:27.225 --> 01:47:30.565
Um, I think our, uh, you know, we, we did note that the,

2293
01:47:30.945 --> 01:47:33.845
in New Zealand in particular, um, and,

2294
01:47:33.865 --> 01:47:36.645
and you know, the, we know the economic conditions in

2295
01:47:36.645 --> 01:47:39.005
New Zealand have become a bit more challenging.

2296
01:47:39.105 --> 01:47:41.485
And so things are moderating there a bit.

2297
01:47:41.505 --> 01:47:42.885
And, and I, yeah, there is some,

2298
01:47:42.885 --> 01:47:45.245
there is some volume challenge as well.

2299
01:47:45.445 --> 01:47:47.365
I dunno whether Amand you wanted to

2300
01:47:47.895 --> 01:47:49.365
Think. I think that's all right. Yeah.

2301
01:47:49.835 --> 01:47:52.365
Okay. Um, I'll move on to my second question then.

2302
01:47:52.665 --> 01:47:55.885
Um, in the past week we've also seen RAA South Australia

2303
01:47:56.025 --> 01:47:57.045
be sold to Allianz.

2304
01:47:57.425 --> 01:47:58.485
Did you look at RAA

2305
01:47:58.545 --> 01:48:00.045
and uh, if you did, you know,

2306
01:48:00.045 --> 01:48:01.565
what were the relative merits you saw in

2307
01:48:01.605 --> 01:48:03.445
RACQ compared to RAA?

2308
01:48:05.405 --> 01:48:07.205
I mean, we won't, we won't comment on other stuff.

2309
01:48:07.785 --> 01:48:11.325
Um, now, I mean, I think I've, I've guided already

2310
01:48:11.355 --> 01:48:15.085
that there, there's a number of, um, insurers

2311
01:48:15.085 --> 01:48:16.485
that got some similar challenges that are,

2312
01:48:16.485 --> 01:48:17.485
that are looking at their futures.

2313
01:48:17.985 --> 01:48:21.205
Um, I'm not sort of come back to what we've done, which is

2314
01:48:22.035 --> 01:48:24.245
sort of on strategy, very retail.

2315
01:48:25.145 --> 01:48:27.485
Um, and you know, we, you know,

2316
01:48:27.585 --> 01:48:30.245
our view is we've been very financially disciplined in

2317
01:48:30.245 --> 01:48:31.725
what we've done, um,

2318
01:48:32.145 --> 01:48:34.165
and sort of we've tried to lay out that profile

2319
01:48:34.265 --> 01:48:35.485
for you so you can see that.

2320
01:48:36.065 --> 01:48:38.445
Um, and you know, we're pretty excited about

2321
01:48:38.445 --> 01:48:40.525
that opportunity and sort of in our sweet spot

2322
01:48:40.985 --> 01:48:44.645
and in our view, it's a natural partnership to be able to,

2323
01:48:45.305 --> 01:48:47.885
to buy into, you know, the Queensland market

2324
01:48:47.885 --> 01:48:49.005
where we're clearly underway.

2325
01:48:51.025 --> 01:48:52.205
And about a month ago, many

2326
01:48:52.205 --> 01:48:54.525
of us in the room were sitting at another insurer's strategy

2327
01:48:54.805 --> 01:48:56.925
briefing where they also talked about under investment in

2328
01:48:56.925 --> 01:48:59.485
commercial, um, with, you know, both yourselves

2329
01:48:59.505 --> 01:49:00.605
and the other insurers

2330
01:49:00.605 --> 01:49:01.885
sharpening their pencils and commercial.

2331
01:49:02.385 --> 01:49:03.805
Do you think you can both grow market

2332
01:49:03.815 --> 01:49:05.165
share from others in the market?

2333
01:49:05.465 --> 01:49:07.885
Or is it more around just becoming more efficient?

2334
01:49:08.785 --> 01:49:11.045
Uh, for us it's really, we're focused on our own business,

2335
01:49:11.345 --> 01:49:12.645
um, and what we need to do.

2336
01:49:12.985 --> 01:49:15.925
And we see there's pockets of opportunity for us to grow,

2337
01:49:16.465 --> 01:49:18.605
um, and we, we feel we're in a position

2338
01:49:18.605 --> 01:49:19.885
to capitalize on those now.

2339
01:49:20.265 --> 01:49:21.365
Our growth will be modest.

2340
01:49:21.945 --> 01:49:24.205
Um, we have a transformation plan as well

2341
01:49:24.655 --> 01:49:26.685
until we really hit the efficiencies to make,

2342
01:49:26.865 --> 01:49:28.365
to then really drive a growth engine.

2343
01:49:28.425 --> 01:49:30.645
But we certainly have pockets within our business now

2344
01:49:30.875 --> 01:49:32.965
that we look forward and we see growth.

2345
01:49:33.855 --> 01:49:34.845
Great. Thanks very much

2346
01:49:42.815 --> 01:49:43.815
Scott. Um, one

2347
01:49:43.815 --> 01:49:44.765
last question. Thanks very much

2348
01:49:44.905 --> 01:49:46.285
for the opportunity, Philip Wesley

2349
01:49:46.285 --> 01:49:47.525
from Paradise Investments.

2350
01:49:47.595 --> 01:49:50.325
Just wondering, we've obviously learned a lot today about AI

2351
01:49:50.325 --> 01:49:52.245
and how that's being used in the organization.

2352
01:49:52.355 --> 01:49:53.445
Just wondering, Nick,

2353
01:49:53.445 --> 01:49:56.405
maybe if you can give us a comment from a holistic sort

2354
01:49:56.405 --> 01:49:59.525
of point of view, how do you think that the firm benchmarks

2355
01:49:59.545 --> 01:50:01.565
to other peers here in Australia

2356
01:50:01.825 --> 01:50:04.925
and also sort of best practice offshore, please?

2357
01:50:05.765 --> 01:50:07.605
A around AI generally?

2358
01:50:07.705 --> 01:50:09.885
Ar around AI specifically? Yes. Yeah,

2359
01:50:10.115 --> 01:50:11.115
Yeah.

2360
01:50:11.645 --> 01:50:14.085
I mean, we're seeing, we, we, we,

2361
01:50:14.085 --> 01:50:15.845
we have seen sort of different things.

2362
01:50:16.015 --> 01:50:17.845
We've seen sort of

2363
01:50:18.385 --> 01:50:20.565
techno technology driven insurance companies

2364
01:50:20.565 --> 01:50:22.765
that are startups and they've,

2365
01:50:23.075 --> 01:50:25.685
they've generally had some problems, um,

2366
01:50:26.635 --> 01:50:29.205
because they've often haven't been able

2367
01:50:29.205 --> 01:50:31.365
to match the insurance capability with the technology,

2368
01:50:31.985 --> 01:50:34.245
and so they've ended up having capacity,

2369
01:50:34.245 --> 01:50:37.965
but then coming a bit unstuck, really what we're doing,

2370
01:50:38.625 --> 01:50:41.085
you know, we think it makes more sense to look at some

2371
01:50:41.085 --> 01:50:43.045
of those other large players around the world

2372
01:50:43.065 --> 01:50:44.245
and what, what are they doing

2373
01:50:44.305 --> 01:50:47.085
and what, what, what, what can we learn from that?

2374
01:50:47.785 --> 01:50:51.085
Um, every, every, every successful retail

2375
01:50:51.835 --> 01:50:54.525
insurer in the world is investing heavily in technology

2376
01:50:54.545 --> 01:50:55.565
and particularly ai.

2377
01:50:56.225 --> 01:50:59.205
Um, what we're trying to, what we've learned is

2378
01:50:59.745 --> 01:51:03.725
to do it at scale and to industrialize it

2379
01:51:04.105 --> 01:51:07.285
and to sort of, our words sort of democratize that.

2380
01:51:07.785 --> 01:51:10.925
And so not to not to be holding it in the center.

2381
01:51:11.595 --> 01:51:14.085
What we've seen is those companies

2382
01:51:14.085 --> 01:51:16.725
that are doing really well are just, are doing lots and lots

2383
01:51:16.725 --> 01:51:19.685
and lots of small things and lots and lots

2384
01:51:19.765 --> 01:51:21.845
and lots of use cases, lots and lots

2385
01:51:21.845 --> 01:51:24.365
and lots of, um, delivery at pace.

2386
01:51:24.465 --> 01:51:27.605
And you, I think you've got that message from us today that,

2387
01:51:27.605 --> 01:51:31.645
that, that seems to be the playbook for those companies

2388
01:51:31.645 --> 01:51:33.725
that are, that are embracing and doing this well.

2389
01:51:34.345 --> 01:51:37.205
Um, because clearly there's gonna be a greater customer

2390
01:51:37.205 --> 01:51:39.405
experience and over time there's gonna be some productivity

2391
01:51:39.405 --> 01:51:40.405
efficiency gains.

2392
01:51:40.965 --> 01:51:42.965
I think in commercial it's a little bit different.

2393
01:51:43.595 --> 01:51:45.325
It's, you know, there's, there's the role of the,

2394
01:51:45.325 --> 01:51:48.645
the intermediary is sort of, sort of sits there as well

2395
01:51:48.645 --> 01:51:52.045
with a pretty important, um, pretty,

2396
01:51:52.045 --> 01:51:54.205
pretty important customer relationship.

2397
01:51:54.585 --> 01:51:57.125
So generally we've seen it in pricing

2398
01:51:57.785 --> 01:52:01.925
and in claims, um, in, in, in, in, from my observation

2399
01:52:01.925 --> 01:52:03.205
of other commercials.

2400
01:52:03.245 --> 01:52:05.005
I mean, in a way we've had AI

2401
01:52:05.005 --> 01:52:07.285
and IOG for some time, this is not a new topic.

2402
01:52:08.065 --> 01:52:11.365
Um, and you know, in a, so our business model has sort

2403
01:52:11.365 --> 01:52:12.885
of depended upon that approach.

2404
01:52:13.785 --> 01:52:16.165
Um, what we're doing is trying to scale it,

2405
01:52:16.265 --> 01:52:17.285
institutionalize it

2406
01:52:17.285 --> 01:52:20.125
and democratize it, you know, to 14,000 people.

2407
01:52:21.355 --> 01:52:23.405
Yeah, okay. But does, does that sort

2408
01:52:23.405 --> 01:52:25.645
of conceivably mean though that, you know, if you need

2409
01:52:25.645 --> 01:52:29.005
to be doing it at scale to win, then you know,

2410
01:52:29.005 --> 01:52:31.325
that's something that others can do also, really.

2411
01:52:31.585 --> 01:52:33.685
And the reality is that, you know,

2412
01:52:33.965 --> 01:52:36.805
it will actually be something that other competitors

2413
01:52:36.945 --> 01:52:38.645
and peers internationally are doing.

2414
01:52:39.065 --> 01:52:40.965
No doubt. Yeah, I mean, no doubt.

2415
01:52:41.305 --> 01:52:44.485
So then it's the package of IG that matters, isn't it?

2416
01:52:44.485 --> 01:52:46.645
It's the brand, the customer relationship, the culture

2417
01:52:46.665 --> 01:52:48.765
of our place, the capability.

2418
01:52:48.905 --> 01:52:51.925
You know, it's not, I mean, I don't, I don't, I think it's,

2419
01:52:51.925 --> 01:52:53.085
it's the package of things.

2420
01:52:53.105 --> 01:52:54.525
It, it can't just be one thing

2421
01:52:54.525 --> 01:52:56.805
because of course our competitors are investing in,

2422
01:52:57.345 --> 01:53:00.565
in similar type of, um, programs to us.

2423
01:53:00.625 --> 01:53:03.565
So I don't think in itself that's gonna be the thing.

2424
01:53:03.875 --> 01:53:06.365
It's the package of things that rev, that IAG is

2425
01:53:06.635 --> 01:53:08.805
that I think is the source of competitive advantage. Yep.

2426
01:53:08.985 --> 01:53:11.925
And maybe just Thank you build on Nick's pack package

2427
01:53:11.935 --> 01:53:13.085
point just a tiny bit.

2428
01:53:13.465 --> 01:53:14.965
The thing that we've got that's a real

2429
01:53:14.965 --> 01:53:16.205
differentiator is data.

2430
01:53:17.225 --> 01:53:18.365
Um, and you need to be able

2431
01:53:18.365 --> 01:53:20.365
to build great ai, you need great data.

2432
01:53:20.905 --> 01:53:23.125
And the work that our technology teams have done over the

2433
01:53:23.125 --> 01:53:25.565
last decade, we started this journey in 2014,

2434
01:53:26.065 --> 01:53:28.325
has been about assembling particularly in the retail

2435
01:53:28.565 --> 01:53:30.045
business, a really strong data asset.

2436
01:53:30.385 --> 01:53:32.485
And that's powering our AI now.

2437
01:53:32.825 --> 01:53:34.885
And I think, you know, lots of people can spend a lot

2438
01:53:34.885 --> 01:53:36.085
of time on those things,

2439
01:53:36.085 --> 01:53:38.645
but if you don't have access to data that you can utilize,

2440
01:53:39.385 --> 01:53:41.205
um, you, you really can't take advantage

2441
01:53:41.545 --> 01:53:42.725
of the full capability.

2442
01:53:43.505 --> 01:53:44.925
And that's what we are doing now.

2443
01:53:45.505 --> 01:53:47.365
Yep. Okay. Thank you. That's a good point.

2444
01:53:47.665 --> 01:53:51.565
Um, can you also just comment on customer affordability.

2445
01:53:51.565 --> 01:53:53.205
There's obviously a lot of focus on this

2446
01:53:53.225 --> 01:53:55.045
for the government across a whole range of

2447
01:53:55.605 --> 01:53:56.845
consumer type products,

2448
01:53:57.225 --> 01:53:59.845
but you know, where do you see AI in this regard?

2449
01:54:00.185 --> 01:54:02.365
So I'm sorry IAG in this regard.

2450
01:54:02.825 --> 01:54:05.485
Um, and you know, perhaps you can just sort

2451
01:54:05.485 --> 01:54:08.045
of comment on whether you think it is impacting sort

2452
01:54:08.045 --> 01:54:09.045
of pricing and you know,

2453
01:54:09.045 --> 01:54:11.365
perhaps your potential pricing power looking forward.

2454
01:54:11.965 --> 01:54:14.285
I mean, we've been super focused on this point, um,

2455
01:54:15.345 --> 01:54:17.165
and that we know there,

2456
01:54:17.175 --> 01:54:19.725
there are many challenges out there in Australia

2457
01:54:19.725 --> 01:54:21.765
and New Zealand and the cost

2458
01:54:21.765 --> 01:54:24.845
of insurance is not helping those, those challenges.

2459
01:54:25.585 --> 01:54:27.805
Um, house, you know, to household budgets.

2460
01:54:28.765 --> 01:54:30.125
I mean sort of the, and you know,

2461
01:54:30.125 --> 01:54:32.925
we know why the inflation cost of services, cost

2462
01:54:32.925 --> 01:54:35.205
of reinsurance, all the things that have happened,

2463
01:54:35.635 --> 01:54:37.245
just frequency of events.

2464
01:54:37.985 --> 01:54:41.405
Um, sort of the, the, the, the,

2465
01:54:41.945 --> 01:54:44.965
and few, few facts though retention levels have remained

2466
01:54:44.965 --> 01:54:49.085
really strong and I don't think we've seen material exiting

2467
01:54:49.425 --> 01:54:52.005
of the insurance market by households

2468
01:54:52.005 --> 01:54:53.485
and businesses of Australia and New Zealand.

2469
01:54:55.145 --> 01:54:58.085
And, and then sort of the, the slight positive

2470
01:54:58.825 --> 01:55:02.365
is the tone from the team, which is sort of

2471
01:55:02.365 --> 01:55:04.645
that inflationary price per, which was sort

2472
01:55:04.645 --> 01:55:05.685
of double digit everywhere.

2473
01:55:06.465 --> 01:55:09.205
Um, across all insurers, all markets

2474
01:55:09.785 --> 01:55:10.965
is definitely coming back.

2475
01:55:11.745 --> 01:55:14.845
And so motor is, is the most material.

2476
01:55:15.305 --> 01:55:19.845
New Zealand is also materially coming down in, in relation

2477
01:55:19.845 --> 01:55:21.405
to rate of increase.

2478
01:55:21.945 --> 01:55:24.405
So, you know, where it was, everything was double digit now

2479
01:55:24.405 --> 01:55:28.045
it's not, you know, motor, um, is sort of,

2480
01:55:28.065 --> 01:55:29.805
is definitely coming back property.

2481
01:55:29.825 --> 01:55:31.085
You heard Julie's comments

2482
01:55:31.105 --> 01:55:33.485
before that we're cautious about that.

2483
01:55:33.945 --> 01:55:35.645
Uh, but there are some signals that

2484
01:55:35.675 --> 01:55:37.525
that inflationary pressure is coming down

2485
01:55:38.025 --> 01:55:40.285
and commercial, there's sort of a slightly different story.

2486
01:55:40.385 --> 01:55:44.165
So yes, affordability is a major concern there.

2487
01:55:44.315 --> 01:55:46.365
There's lots we've done to help with that.

2488
01:55:46.985 --> 01:55:51.005
Um, the outlook from here is probably slightly better, um,

2489
01:55:51.025 --> 01:55:53.765
around that driven by cost of reinsurance as well.

2490
01:55:53.825 --> 01:55:56.245
We sort of see the, the, the, the,

2491
01:55:56.245 --> 01:55:57.725
there's more positive signals around that.

2492
01:55:58.505 --> 01:56:01.525
Um, and so for households, the out the sort

2493
01:56:01.605 --> 01:56:04.085
of the outlook is probably slightly more favorable than

2494
01:56:04.085 --> 01:56:06.485
what the last one to two years has been, which has been,

2495
01:56:06.985 --> 01:56:08.005
you know, really challenging

2496
01:56:08.065 --> 01:56:09.485
for challenging to run the insurance company.

2497
01:56:09.555 --> 01:56:10.685
Very challenging for consumer

2498
01:56:10.685 --> 01:56:13.165
and businesses around the, the cost of insurance.

2499
01:56:15.615 --> 01:56:16.045
Thank you.

2500
01:56:20.105 --> 01:56:20.945
I think we're good.

2501
01:56:21.405 --> 01:56:24.185
Um, I mean, just let me just, let me close

2502
01:56:24.285 --> 01:56:26.465
before, um, I invite those of us

2503
01:56:26.485 --> 01:56:28.145
to in the room to come for lunch.

2504
01:56:28.825 --> 01:56:30.305
I mean, we're, we, we,

2505
01:56:30.305 --> 01:56:32.665
what you see today is definitely a stronger

2506
01:56:33.045 --> 01:56:34.465
and a more resilient IAG.

2507
01:56:35.085 --> 01:56:36.985
Um, and there's just a boatload of things

2508
01:56:36.985 --> 01:56:39.865
that have happened here over the last number of years

2509
01:56:39.895 --> 01:56:41.145
that have got us to this position.

2510
01:56:41.145 --> 01:56:42.345
So we're really proud about that.

2511
01:56:43.085 --> 01:56:45.585
You can tell what within that, you know, two thirds

2512
01:56:45.585 --> 01:56:46.945
of the company's our retail business.

2513
01:56:47.285 --> 01:56:48.825
And you can see we've transformed that.

2514
01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:52.665
We've, we've, we've delivered a trans tasman common platform

2515
01:56:52.965 --> 01:56:56.265
for claims policy and pricing and admin.

2516
01:56:56.545 --> 01:56:58.225
I mean, that's, that's not easy to achieve.

2517
01:56:58.245 --> 01:57:01.065
And what that really sets ourselves up at the same time

2518
01:57:01.065 --> 01:57:02.665
within our commercial businesses,

2519
01:57:03.115 --> 01:57:05.585
we've really been super focused on underwriting discipline.

2520
01:57:05.695 --> 01:57:06.945
There's some more technology

2521
01:57:07.005 --> 01:57:08.785
and spend that still has to occur there.

2522
01:57:09.165 --> 01:57:11.465
But, you know, we've moved that business a mile

2523
01:57:11.885 --> 01:57:14.465
and we see that as sort of as, as opportunity for us.

2524
01:57:15.165 --> 01:57:17.505
Um, at the same time, we're gonna be,

2525
01:57:17.505 --> 01:57:19.905
we're gonna be disciplined in, in how we spend our money.

2526
01:57:20.405 --> 01:57:22.785
And so, you know, we've outlined that we still,

2527
01:57:22.785 --> 01:57:25.145
productivity efficiency technology's part of that.

2528
01:57:25.515 --> 01:57:27.545
We're gonna take at least a hundred basis points out

2529
01:57:27.545 --> 01:57:29.745
of the expense ratio over the next couple of years.

2530
01:57:30.045 --> 01:57:31.905
And we're gonna continue to be diligent in that.

2531
01:57:32.725 --> 01:57:35.345
And then we're gonna package that up with this sort of,

2532
01:57:35.345 --> 01:57:37.945
this story that, that this thing that I, I,

2533
01:57:38.065 --> 01:57:41.545
I strongly believe in around a sort of a, a capital light,

2534
01:57:42.045 --> 01:57:44.905
low volatility insurance company, which is what, you know,

2535
01:57:45.025 --> 01:57:46.745
I-A-G-I-A-G is.

2536
01:57:47.165 --> 01:57:49.505
Um, and, you know, we're gonna continue down that path.

2537
01:57:50.285 --> 01:57:54.705
So, um, thank you everyone for your interest in, in IAG um,

2538
01:57:54.755 --> 01:57:56.785
those online will say goodbye.

2539
01:57:56.785 --> 01:57:58.785
And thank you for participating those in the room.

2540
01:57:59.325 --> 01:58:02.665
Uh, we, we, we ask you to, to join us for, for a light lunch

2541
01:58:02.695 --> 01:58:04.585
with, with all the management team, uh,

2542
01:58:04.585 --> 01:58:05.625
here in our premises in Sydney.

2543
01:58:05.885 --> 01:58:06.825
Hey, thanks again everybody.
